<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The leading article in this collection appeared, as first
published, in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> in October, 1869.
After this essay was written I became better acquainted
with our plain German sects, and wrote articles describing
them, which were published in the first edition
of this book. It appeared in 1872.</p>

<p>To the second edition were added “Bethlehem and
the Moravians” and “Schwenkfelders,” as well as an
Appendix, and the edition was published about the
opening of 1874.</p>

<p>The present volume contains articles that have never
before appeared in book-form, namely, “The Miners
of Scranton,” “Irish Farmers,” and “English.” However,
the first was published in <i>Harpers’ Magazine</i> for
November, 1877. Another short article appeared earlier
in the same periodical; and several other essays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
were first brought before the public in Philadelphia and
New York papers.</p>

<p>From personal observation I have been able to revise
a considerable part of this volume, which contains more
than double the amount of matter comprised in the first
edition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PENNSYLVANIA_DUTCH">“PENNSYLVANIA DUTCH.”<br />
<span class="smaller">(PROPERLY GERMAN.)</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I have lived for twenty years in the county of Lancaster,
where my neighbors on all sides are “Pennsylvania
Dutch.” In this article I shall try to give, from
my own observation and familiar acquaintance, some
account of the life of a people who are little known
outside of the rural neighborhoods of their own State,
who have much that is peculiar in their language, customs,
and belief, and of whom I have learned to esteem
the native good sense, friendly feeling, and religious
character.</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p>The tongue which these people speak is a dialect of
the German, but they generally call it and themselves
“Dutch.”</p>

<p>For the native German who works with them on
the farm they entertain some contempt, and the title
“Yankee” is with them a synonyme for cheat. As
must always be the case where the great majority do not
read the tongue which they speak, and live in contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
with those who speak another, the language has become
mixed and corrupt. Seeing a young neighbor cleaning
a buggy, I tried to talk with him by speaking German.
“Willst du reiten?” said I (not remembering that
<i>reiten</i> is to ride on horseback). “Willst du reiten?”
All my efforts were vain.</p>

<p>As I was going for cider to the house of a neighboring
farmer, I asked his daughter what she would say,
under the circumstances, for “Are you going to ride?”
“Widdu fawray? Buggy fawray?” was the answer.
(Willst du fahren?) Such expressions are heard as
“Koock amul to,” for “Guck einmal da,” or “Just
look at that!” and “Haltybissel” for “Halt ein
biszchen,” or “Wait a little bit.” “Gutenobit” is used
for “Guten Abend.” Apple-butter is “lodwaerrick,”
from the German <i>latwerge</i>, an electuary, or an electuary
of prunes. Our “Dutch” is much mixed with English.
I once asked a woman what pie-crust is in Dutch, “Py-kroosht,”
she answered.</p>

<p>Those who speak English use uncommon expressions,
as,—“That’s a werry <i>lasty</i> basket” (meaning durable);
“I seen him yet a’ready;” “I knew a woman that had
a good baby <i>wunst</i>;” “The bread is all” (all gone). I
have heard the carpenter call his plane <i>she</i>, and a housekeeper
apply the same pronoun to her home-made soap.</p>

<p>A rich landed proprietor is sometimes called <i>king</i>.
An old “Dutchman” who was absent from home thus
narrated the cause of his journey: “I must go and see
old Yoke (Jacob) Beidelman. Te people calls me te
kink ov te Manor (township), and tay calls him te kink
ov te Octorara. Now, dese kinks must come togeder
once.” (Accent <i>together</i>, and pass quickly over <i>once</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3>RELIGION.</h3>

<p>I called recently on my friend and neighbor, Jacob
S., who is a thrifty farmer, of a good mind, and a
member of the old Mennist or Mennonite Society. I
once accompanied him and his pleasant wife to their
religious meeting. The meeting-house is a low brick
building, with neat surroundings, and resembles a
Friends’ meeting-house. The Mennonists in some outward
matters very much resemble the Society of Friends
(or Quakers), but do not rely, in the especial manner
that Friends do, upon the teachings of the Divine Spirit
in the secret stillness of the soul.</p>

<p>In the interior of the Mennist meeting a Quaker-like
plainness prevails. The men, with broad-brimmed hats
and simple dress, sit on benches on one side of the house,
and the women, in plain caps and black sun-bonnets,
are ranged on the other; while a few gay dresses are
worn by the young people who have not yet joined the
meeting. The services are almost always conducted in
“Dutch,” and consist of exhortation and prayer, and
singing by the congregation. The singing is without
previous training, and is not musical. A pause of about
five minutes is allowed for private prayer.</p>

<p>The preachers are not paid, and are chosen in the following
manner. When a vacancy occurs, and a new
appointment is required, several men go into a small
room, chosen for the purpose; and to them, waiting,
enter singly the men and women, as many as choose,
who tell them the name of the person preferred by each
to fill the vacancy. After this, an opportunity is given
to any candidate to excuse himself from the service.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Those who are not excused, if, for instance, six in number,
are brought before six books. Each candidate takes
up a book, and the one within whose book a lot is found
is the chosen minister. I asked my friends who gave
me some of these details, whether it was claimed or believed
that there is any special guidance of the Divine
Spirit in thus choosing a minister. From the reply, I
did not learn that any such guidance is claimed, though
they spoke of a man who <i>was led</i> to pass his hand over
all the other books, and who selected the last one, but
he did not get the lot after all. He was thought to be
ambitious of a place in the ministry.</p>

<p>The three prominent sects of Mennonites all claim to
be non-resistants, or <i>wehrlos</i>. The Old Mennists, who
are the most numerous and least rigid, vote at elections,
and are allowed to hold such public offices as school director
and road supervisor, but not to be members of the
legislature. The ministers are expected not to vote.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The members of this society cannot bring suit against
any one; they can hold mortgages, but not judgment
bonds.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Like Quakers, they were not allowed to hold
slaves, and they do not take oaths nor deal in spirituous
liquors.</p>

<p>My neighbor Jacob and I were once talking of the
general use of the word “Yankee” to denote one who is
rather unfair in his dealings. They sometimes speak of
a “Dutch Yankee;” and Jacob asked me whether, if
going to sell a horse, I should tell the buyer every fault<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
that I knew the horse had, as he maintained was the
proper course. His brother-in-law, who was at times a
horse-dealer, did not agree with him.</p>

<p>Titles do not abound among these plain neighbors of
ours. Jacob’s little son used to call him “Jake,” as he
heard the hired men do. Nevertheless, one of our New
Mennist acquaintances was quite courtly in his address.</p>

<p>This last-mentioned sect branched off some fifty years
ago, and claim to be <i>reformirt</i>, or to have returned to an
older and more excellent standard. They do not vote
at all. Their most striking peculiarity is this: if one of
the members is disowned by the church, the other members
of his own family who are members of the meeting
are not allowed to eat at the same table with him, and
his wife withdraws from him. A woman who worked
in such a family told me how unpleasant it was to her
to see that the father did not take his seat at the table,
to which she was invited.</p>

<p>In support of this practice, they refer to the eleventh
verse of the fifth chapter of First Corinthians: “But
now I have written unto you not to keep company, if
any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous,
or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an
extortioner; with such an one <i>no not to eat</i>.”</p>

<p>We have yet another sect among us, called Amish
(pronounced Ommish). In former times these Mennists
were sometimes known as “beardy men,” but of late
years the beard is not a distinguishing trait. It is said
that a person once asked an Amish man the difference
between themselves and another Mennist sect. “Vy,
dey vears puttons, and ve vearsh hooks oont eyes;” and
this is, in fact, a prime difference. All the Mennist sects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
retain the ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s supper,
but most also practise feet-washing, and some sectarians
“greet one another with a holy kiss.”</p>

<p>On a Sunday morning Amish wagons, covered with
yellow oil-cloth, may be seen moving toward the house
of that member whose turn it is to have the meeting.
Great have been the preparations there beforehand,—the
whitewashing, the scrubbing, the polishing of tin and
brass. Wooden benches and other seats are provided
for the “meeting-folks,” and the services resemble those
already described. Of course, young mothers do not
stay at home, but bring their infants with them. When
the meeting is over, the congregation remain to dinner.
Bean soup was formerly the principal dish, but, with the
progress of luxury, the farmers of a fat soil no longer
confine themselves to so simple a diet. Imagine what a
time of social intercourse this must be.</p>

<p>The Amish dress is peculiar; and the children are
diminutive men and women. The women wear sun-bonnets
and closely-fitting dresses, but often their figures
look very trim, in brown, with green or other bright
handkerchiefs meeting over the breast. I saw a group
of Amish at the railroad station the other day,—men,
women, and a little boy. One of the young women
wore a pasteboard sun-bonnet covered with black, and
tied with narrow blue ribbon, among which showed
the thick white strings of her Amish cap; a gray
shawl, without fringe; a brown stuff dress, and a purple
apron. One middle-aged man, inclined to corpulence,
had coarse, brown, woollen clothes, and his pantaloons
were without suspenders, in the Amish fashion. No
buttons were on his coat behind, but down the front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
were hooks and eyes. One young girl wore a bright
brown sun-bonnet, a green dress, and a light blue
apron. The choicest figure, however, was the six-year-old,
in a jacket, and with pantaloons plentifully plaited
into the waistband behind; hair cut straight over the
forehead, and hanging to the shoulder; and a round-crowned
black wool hat, with an astonishingly wide
brim. The little girls, down to two years old, wear
the plain cap, and the handkerchief crossed upon the
breast.</p>

<p>In Amish houses the love of ornament appears in
brightly scoured utensils,—how the brass ladles are
made to shine!—and in embroidered towels, one end of
the towel showing a quantity of work in colored cottons.
When steel or elliptic springs were introduced, so great
a novelty was not at first patronized by members of the
meeting; but an infirm brother, desiring to visit his
friends, directed the blacksmith to put a spring inside
his wagon, under the seat, and since that time steel
springs have become common. I have even seen a
youth with flowing hair (as is common among the Amish),
and two trim-bodied damsels, riding in a very plain,
uncovered buggy. A. Z. rode in a common buggy; but
he became a great backslider, poor man!</p>

<p>It was an Amish man, not well versed in the English
language, from whom I bought poultry, who sent me a
bill for “chighans.”</p>

<p>In mentioning some ludicrous circumstances, far be
it from me to ignore the virtues of these primitive
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<h3>HISTORY OF A SECT.</h3>

<p>The Mennonites are named from Menno Symons, a
reformer, who died in 1561, though it is doubtful
whether Menno founded the sect. “The prevailing
opinion among church historians, especially those of
Holland, is that the origin of the Dutch Baptists may
be traced to the Waldenses, and that Menno merely
organized the concealed and scattered congregations as
a denomination.”</p>

<p>Mosheim says, “The true origin of that sect, which
acquired the denomination of Anabaptists, by their administering
anew the rite of baptism to those who came
over to their communion, and derived that of Mennonites
from the famous man to whom they owe the greatest
part of their present felicity, is hidden in the depths
of antiquity, and is of consequence extremely difficult
to be ascertained.” The “Martyr-Book,” or “Martyr’s
Mirror,” in use among our Mennonites, endeavors to
prove identity of doctrine between the Waldenses and
these Baptists, as regards opposition to infant baptism,
to war, and to oaths.</p>

<p>Although the Mennonites are very numerous in the
county of Lancaster, yet in the whole State they were
estimated, in 1850, to have but ninety-two churches,
while the Lutherans and German Reformed together
were estimated as having seven hundred.</p>

<p>The freedom of religious opinion which was allowed
in Pennsylvania had the effect of drawing hither the
continental Europeans, who established themselves in
the fertile lands of the western part of the county of
Chester, now Lancaster. It was not until the revolution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of 1848 that the different German states granted
full civil rights to the Mennonites; and in some cases
this freedom has since been withdrawn; Hanover, in
1858, annulled the election of a representative to the
second chamber, because he was a Mennonite. Much of
this opposition probably is because the sect refuse to
take oaths. With such opposing circumstances in the
Old World, it is not remarkable that the number of
Mennonites in the United States has been reported to
exceed that in all the rest of the world put together.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The Amish are named from Jacob Amen, a Swiss
Mennonite preacher of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>As I understand the Mennonites, they endeavor in
church government literally to carry out the injunction
of Jesus, “Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against
thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with
thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word may be established. And if he
shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church; but
if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
an heathen man and a publican.”</p>

<p>Besides these sectaries, we have among us Dunkers
(German <i>tunken</i>, to dip), from whom sprang the Seventh-Day
Baptists of Ephratah, with their brother- and sister-houses
of celibates.</p>

<p>Also at Litiz we have the Moravian church and
Gottesacker (or churchyard), and a Moravian church at
Lancaster. Here, according to custom, a love-feast was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
held recently, when a cup of coffee and a rusk (sweet
biscuit) were handed to each person present.</p>

<p>We have, too, a number of “Dutch Methodists,” or
<i>Albrechtsleute</i> (followers of Albrecht), to whom is given
the name Evangelical Association. These are full of
zeal or activity in church, like the early Methodists;
and I saw a young man fall apparently into a trance
at a camp-meeting, lying upon the ground, to the satisfaction
of his wife, who probably thought he was
“happy.”</p>

<h3>POLITICS.</h3>

<p>As our county was represented in Congress by Thaddeus
Stevens, you have some idea of what our politics
are. We have returned about five or six thousand
majority for the Whig, Anti-Masonic, and Republican
ticket, and the adjoining very “Dutch” county of Berks
invariably as great a majority for the Democratic. So
striking a difference has furnished much ground for
speculation. The Hon. John Strohm says that Berks
is Democratic because so many Hessians settled there
after the Revolution. “No,” says the Hon. Mr. B.,
“I attribute it to the fact that the people are not taught
by unpaid ministers, as with us, but are Lutherans and
German Reformed, and can be led by their preachers.”
“Why is Berks Democratic?” I once asked our Democratic
postmaster. “I do not know,” said he; “but the
people here are ignorant; they do not read a paper on
the other side.” A former postmaster tells me that he
has heard that the people of Berks were greatly in favor
of liberty in the time of the elder Adams; that they put
up liberty-poles, and Adams sent soldiers among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and had the liberty-poles cut down; and “ever since
they have been opposed to that political party, under its
different names.”</p>

<p>A gentleman of Reading has told me that he heard
James Buchanan express, in the latter part of his life,
a similar opinion to one given before. Mr. Buchanan
said, in effect, that while peace sects prevailed in Lancaster
County, in Berks were found many Lutherans
and German Reformed, who were more liberal (according,
of course, to Mr. Buchanan’s interpretation of the
word).</p>

<p>The troubles alluded to in Berks seem to have been
principally on account of a direct tax, called “the
house-tax,” imposed during the administration of John
Adams.</p>

<p>The people of Berks and Lancaster gave another
striking proof of the difference of their political sentiments,
on the question of holding the Constitutional
Convention of 1874. The vote of Berks was 5269 for
a convention, and 10,905 against a convention; the vote
of Lancaster was, for a convention 16,862, against the
same 116.</p>

<p>A gentleman of Easton, Northampton County, tells
me of a German farmer, who lived near that town, who
said he did not see any need of so many parties,—the
Democrats and Lutherans were enough. On his death-bed
he is reported to have said to his son, “I never
voted anything but the Democratic ticket, and I want
you to stick to the party.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<h3>FESTIVALS.</h3>

<p>The greatest festive occasion, or the one which calls
the greatest number of persons to eat and drink together,
is the funeral.</p>

<p>My friends Jacob and Susanna E. have that active
benevolence and correct principle which prompt to a
care for the sick and dying, and kind offices toward the
mourner. Nor are they alone in this. When a death
occurs, our “Dutch” neighbors enter the house, and,
taking possession, relieve the family as far as possible
from the labors and cares of a funeral. Some “redd
up” the house, making that which was neglected during
the sad presence of a fatal disease again in order for the
reception of company. Others visit the kitchen, and
help to bake great store of bread, pies, and rusks for
the expected gathering. Two young men and two young
women generally sit up together overnight to watch in
a room adjoining that of the dead.</p>

<p>At funerals occurring on Sunday three hundred carriages
have been seen in attendance; and so great at all
times is the concourse of people of all stations and all
shades of belief, and so many partake of the entertainment
liberally provided, that I may be excused for calling
funerals the great festivals of the “Dutch.” (Weddings
are also highly festive occasions, but they are
confined to the “freundschaft,” and to much smaller
numbers.)</p>

<p>The services at funerals are generally conducted in
the German language.</p>

<p>An invitation is extended to the persons present to
return to eat after the funeral, or the meal is partaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of before leaving for the graveyard: hospitality, in all
rural districts, where the guests come from afar, seems
to require this. The tables are sometimes set in a barn,
or large wagon-house, and relays of guests succeed one
another, until all are done. The neighbors wait upon
the table. The entertainment generally consists of meat,
frequently cold; bread and butter; pickles or sauces,
such as apple-butter; pies and rusks; sometimes stewed
chickens, mashed potatoes, cheese, etc.; and coffee invariably.
All depart after the dish-washing, and the
family is left in quiet again.</p>

<p>I have said that persons of all shades of belief attend
funerals; but our New Mennists are not permitted to
listen to the sermons of other denominations. Memorial
stones over the dead are more conspicuous than among
Friends; but they are still quite plain, with simple inscriptions.
Occasionally family graveyards are seen.
One on a farm adjoining ours seems cut out of the side
of a field; it stands back from the high-road, and access
to it is on foot. To those who are anxious to preserve
the remains of their relatives, these graveyards are objectionable,
as they will probably not be regarded after
the property has passed into another family.</p>

<p>A Lutheran gentleman, living in Berks County, in
speaking of the great funerals among the “Dutch,” says,
“Our Germans look forward all their lives to their
funerals, hoping to be able to entertain their friends on
that great occasion with the hospitality due to them, and
the honor due to the memory of the departed.” No
spirituous liquors, he added, are <i>now</i> used at funerals, the
clergy having discouraged their use on these religious
occasions. In a mountain valley in Carbon County,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
about thirty years ago, a bottle of whiskey was handed to
a Lutheran minister, and he was asked to take some.
“Yes, I’ll have some,” he answered; and taking the
bottle, he broke it against a tree.</p>

<h3>WEDDINGS.</h3>

<p>Our farmer had a daughter married lately, and I was
invited to see the bride leave home. The groom, in
accordance with the early habits of the “Dutch” folks,
reached the bride’s house about six in the morning,
having previously breakfasted and ridden four miles.
As he probably fed and harnessed his horse, besides attiring
himself for the grand occasion, he must have been
up betimes on an October morning.</p>

<p>The bride wore purple mousseline-de-laine and a blue
bonnet. As some of the “wedding-folks” were dilatory,
the bride and groom did not get off before seven.
The bridegroom was a mechanic. The whole party was
composed of four couples, who rode to Lancaster in buggies,
where two pairs were married by a minister. In
the afternoon the newly-married couples went down to
Philadelphia for a few days; and on the evening that
they were expected at home we had a reception, or home-coming.
Supper consisted of roast turkeys, beef, and
stewed chickens, cakes, pies, and coffee of course. We
had raisin-pie, which is a great treat in “Dutchland” on
festive or solemn occasions. “Nine couples” of the
party sat down to supper, and then the remaining spare
seats were occupied by the landlord’s wife, the bride’s
uncle, etc. We had a fiddler in the evening. He and
the dancing would not have been there had the household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
“belonged to meeting;” and, as it was, some young
Methodist girls did not dance.</p>

<p>One of my “English” acquaintances was sitting alone
on a Sunday evening, when she heard a rap at the door,
and a young “Dutchman,” a stranger, walked in and
sat down, “and there he sot, and sot, and sot.” Mrs.
G. waited to hear his errand, politely making conversation;
and finally he asked whether her daughter was at
home. “Which one?” He did not know. But that
did not make much difference, as neither was at home.
Mrs. G. afterwards mentioned this circumstance to a
worthy “Dutch” neighbor, expressing surprise that a
young man should call who had not been introduced.
“How then <i>would</i> they get acquainted?” said he. She
suggested that she did not think that her daughter knew
the young man. “She would not tell you, perhaps, if
she did.” The daughter, however, when asked, seemed
entirely ignorant, and did not know that she had ever
seen the young man. He had probably seen her at the
railroad station, and had found out her name and residence.
It would seem to indicate much confidence on
the part of parents, if, when acquaintances are formed
in such a manner, the father and mother retire at nine
o’clock, and leave their young daughter thus to “keep
company” until midnight or later. It is no wonder that
one of our German sects has declared against the popular
manner of “courting.”</p>

<p>I recently attended a New Mennist wedding, which
took place in the frame meeting-house. We entered
through an adjoining brick dwelling, one room of which
served as an ante-room, where the “sisters” left their
bonnets and shawls. I was late, for the services had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
begun about nine on a bitter Sunday morning in December.
The meeting-house was crowded, and in front
on the left was a plain of book-muslin caps on the heads
of the sisters. On shelves and pegs, along the other
side, were placed the hats and overcoats of the brethren.
The building was extremely simple,—whitewashed without,
entirely unpainted within, with whitewashed walls.
The preacher stood at a small, unpainted desk, and before
it was a table, convenient for the old men “to sit
at and lay their books on.” Two stoves, a half-dozen
hanging tin candlesticks, and the benches completed the
furniture. The preacher was speaking extemporaneously
in English, for in this meeting-house the services are
often performed in this tongue; and he spoke readily
and well, though his speech was not free from such expressions
as, “It would be wishful for men to do their
duty;” “Man cannot separate them together;” and
“This, Christ done for us.”</p>

<p>He spoke at length upon divorce, which, he said,
could not take place between Christians. The preacher
spoke especially upon the duty of the wife to submit to
the husband whenever differences of sentiment arose; of
the duty of the husband to love the wife, and to show
his love by his readiness to assist her. He alluded to
Paul’s saying that it is better to be unmarried than
married, and he did not scruple to use plain language
touching adultery. His discourse ended, he called upon
the pair proposing marriage to come forward; whereupon
the man and woman rose from the body of the
congregation on either side, and, coming out to the middle
aisle, stood together before the minister. They had
both passed their early youth, but had very good faces.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
The bride wore a mode-colored alpaca, and a black
apron; also a clear-starched cap without a border, after
the fashion of the sect. The groom wore a dark-green
coat, cut “shad-bellied,” after the fashion of the brethren.</p>

<p>This was probably the manner of their acquaintance:
If, in spite of Paul’s encouragement to a single life, a
brother sees a sister whom he wishes to marry, he mentions
the fact to a minister, who tells it to the sister. If
she agrees in sentiment, the acquaintance continues for
a year, during which private interviews can be had if
desired; but this sect entirely discourages courting as
usually practised among the “Dutch.”</p>

<p>The year having in this case elapsed, and the pair
having now met before the preacher, he propounded to
them three questions:</p>

<p>1. I ask of this brother, as the bridegroom, do you
believe that this sister in the faith is allotted to you by
God as your helpmeet and spouse? And I ask of you,
as the bride, do you believe that this your brother is
allotted to you by God as your husband and head?</p>

<p>2. Are you free in your affections from all others, and
have you them centred alone upon this your brother or
sister?</p>

<p>3. Do you receive this person as your lawfully wedded
husband [wife], do you promise to be faithful to
him [her], to reverence him [to love her], and that nothing
but death shall separate you; that, by the help of
God, you will, to the best of your ability, fulfil all the
duties which God has enjoined on believing husbands
and wives?</p>

<p>In answering this last question, I observed the bride
to lift her eyes to the preacher’s face, as if in fearless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
trust. Then the preacher, directing them to join hands,
pronounced them man and wife, and invoked a blessing
upon them. This was followed by a short prayer, after
which the wedded pair separated, each again taking
a place among the congregation. The occasion was
solemn. On resuming his place in the desk, the
preacher’s eyes were seen to be suffused, and pocket-handkerchiefs
were visible on either side (the sisters’
white, those of the brethren of colored silk). The
audience then knelt, while the preacher prayed, and I
heard responses like those of the Methodists, but more
subdued. The preacher made a few remarks, to the
effect that, although it would be grievous to break
the bond now uniting these two, it would be infinitely
more grievous to break the tie which unites us to
Christ; and then a quaint hymn was sung to a familiar
tune. This “church” does not allow wedding-parties,
but a few friends may gather at the house
after meeting.</p>

<p>At Amish weddings the meeting is not in a church,
like the one just spoken of, for their meetings are held in
private houses. I hear that none go to this meeting but
invited guests, except that the preachers are always
present; and after the ceremony the wedded pair with
the preachers retire into a private apartment, perhaps
for exhortation upon their new duties.</p>

<p>A neighbor tells me that the Amish have great fun at
weddings; that they have a table set all night, and that
when the weather is pleasant they play in the barn.
“Our Pete went once,” she continued, “with a lot of
the public-school scholars. They let them go in and
look on. They twisted a towel for the bloom-sock, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
they did hit each other.” (Bloom-sock, <i>plump-sack</i>, a
twisted kerchief,—a clumsy fellow.)</p>

<p>“The bloom-sock” (<i>oo</i> short), I hear, “is a handkerchief
twisted long, from the two opposite corners. When
it is twisted, you double it, and tie the ends with a knot.
One in front hunts the handkerchief, and those on the
bench are passing it behind them. If they get a chance,
they’ll hit him with it, and if he sees it he tears it away.
Then he goes into the row, and the other goes out to
hunt it.”</p>

<p>It has also been said that at Amish wedding-parties
they have what they call <i>Glücktrinke</i>, of wine, etc.
Some wedding-parties are called infares. Thus, a
neighbor spoke of “Siegfried’s wedding, where they
had such an infare.” The original meaning I suppose
to be home-coming.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from these descriptions that
we have no “fashionable” persons among us, of the old
German stock. When they have become fashionable,
however, they do not desire to be called “Dutch.”</p>

<h3>QUILTINGS.</h3>

<p>There lives in our neighborhood a pleasant, industrious
“Aunt Sally,” a yellow woman; and one day she
had a quilting, for she had long wished to re-cover two
quilts. The first who arrived at Aunt Sally’s was our
neighbor from over the “creek,” or mill-stream, Polly
M., in her black silk Mennist bonnet, formed like a sun-bonnet;
and at ten came my dear friend Susanna E.,
who is tall and fat, and very pleasant; who has Huguenot
blood in her veins, and—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whose heart has a look southward, and is open</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the great noon of nature.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Aunt Sally had her quilt up in her landlord’s east room,
for her own house was too small. However, at about
eleven she called us over to dinner; for people who have
breakfasted at five or six have an appetite at eleven.</p>

<p>We found on the table beefsteaks, boiled pork, sweet
potatoes, kohl-slaw,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> pickled tomatoes, cucumbers, and
red beets (thus the “Dutch” accent lies), apple-butter
and preserved peaches, pumpkin- and apple-pie, with
sponge-cake and coffee.</p>

<p>After dinner came our next neighbors, “the maids,”
Susy and Katy Groff, who live in single blessedness and
great neatness. They wore pretty, clear-starched Mennist
caps, very plain. Katy is a sweet-looking woman;
and, although she is more than sixty years old, her forehead
is almost unwrinkled, and her fine fair hair is still
brown. It was late when the farmer’s wife came,—three
o’clock; for she had been to Lancaster. She wore
hoops, and was of the “world’s people.” These women
all spoke “Dutch;” for “the maids,” whose ancestor
came here probably one hundred and fifty years ago, do
not yet speak English with fluency.</p>

<p>The first subject of conversation was the fall house-cleaning;
and I heard mention of “die carpet hinaus
an der fence,” and “die fenshter und die porch;” and
the exclamation, “My goodness, es war schlimm” (it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
was bad). I quilted faster than Katy Groff, who showed
me her hands, and said, “You have not been corn-husking,
as I have.”</p>

<p>So we quilted and rolled, talked and laughed, got one
quilt done, and put in another. The work was not fine;
we laid it out by chalking around a small plate. Aunt
Sally’s desire was rather to get her quilting finished
upon this great occasion, than for us to put in a quantity
of needlework.</p>

<p>About five o’clock we were called to supper. I need
not tell you all the particulars of this plentiful meal. But
the stewed chicken was tender, and we had coffee again.</p>

<p>Polly M.’s husband now came over the creek in the
boat, to take her home, and he warned her against the
evening dampness. The rest of us quilted a while by
candle and lamp, and got the second quilt done at about
seven.</p>

<p>At this quilting I heard but little gossip, and less
scandal. I displayed my new alpaca, and my dyed
merino, and the Philadelphia bonnet which exposes the
back of my head to the wintry blast. Polly, for her
part, preferred her black silk sun-bonnet; and so we
parted, with mutual invitations to visit.</p>

<h3>“SINGINGS.”</h3>

<p>Mary ⸺ tells me that she once attended a “singing”
among the Amish. About nightfall, on a Sunday
evening in summer, a half-dozen “girls” and a few more
“boys” met at the house of one of the members. They
talked a while first on common subjects, and then sang
hymns from the Amish hymn-book in the German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
tongue. They chanted in the slow manner common in
their religious meetings; but Mary says that some are
now learning to sing by note, and are improving their
manner. They thus intoned until about ten o’clock,
and then laid aside their hymn-books, and the old folks
went to bed. Then the young people went out into the
wash-house, or outside kitchen, so as not to wake the
sleepers, and played, “Come, Philander, let’s be marching,”
and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The needle’s eye we do supply</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With thread that runs so true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a lass have I let pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because I wanted you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Which game seems to be the same as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Open the gates as high as the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let King George and his troops go by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In these kissing plays, and in some little romping among
the young men, the time was spent until about two or
three in the morning, when they separated, two girls
from a distance staying all night. Mary was able to
sleep until daylight only, for no allowance is made for
those who partake in these gay vigils to make up in the
morning for loss of sleep.</p>

<p>There were no refreshments upon this occasion, but
once at a singing at Christ. Yoder’s, it is said that the
party took nearly all the pies out of the cellar, and
the empty plates were found in the wash-house next
morning.</p>

<p>Dancing-parties are not unknown among us, but they
are not popular among the plain people whom I especially
describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<h3>FARMING.</h3>

<p>In this fertile limestone district farming is very laborious,
being entirely by tillage. Our regular routine
is once in five years to plough the sod ground for corn.
In the next ensuing year the same ground is sowed with
oats; and when the oats come off in August, the industrious
“Dutchmen” immediately manure the stubble-land
for wheat. I have seen them laying the dark-brown
heaps upon the yellow stubble, when, in August, I have
ridden some twelve or fourteen miles down to the hill-country
for blackberries.</p>

<p>After the ground is carefully prepared, wheat and
timothy (grass) seed are put in with a drill, and in the
ensuing spring clover is sowed upon the same ground.
By July, when the wheat is taken off the ground, the
clover and timothy are growing, and will be ready to
mow in the next or fourth summer. In the fifth the
same grass constitutes a grazing-ground, and then the
sod is ready to be broken up again for Indian corn.
Potatoes are seldom planted here in great quantities; a
part of one of the oat-fields or corn-fields can be put
into potatoes, and the ground will be ready by fall to
be put into wheat, if it is desired. A successful farmer
put more than half of his forty acres into wheat; this
being considered the best crop. The average crop of
wheat is about twenty bushels, of Indian corn about
forty. I have heard of one hundred bushels of corn in
the Pequea valley, but this is very rare.</p>

<p>When the wheat and oats are in the barn or stack,
enormous eight-horse threshers, whose owners go about
the neighborhood from farm to farm, thresh the crop in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
two or three days; and thus what was once a great job
for winter may all be finished by the first of October.</p>

<p>Jacob E. is a model farmer. His buildings and fences
are in good order, and his cattle well kept. He is a
little past the prime of life; his beautiful head of black
hair being touched with silver. His wife is dimpled
and smiling, and her weight of nearly two hundred
does not prevent her being active, energetic, forehanded,
and “thorough-going.” During the winter months the
two sons go to the public school,—the older one with
reluctance; there they learn to read and write and
cipher, and possibly they study geography; they speak
English at school, and “Dutch” at home. Much education
the “Dutch” farmer fears, as productive of laziness;
and laziness is a mortal sin here. The E.’s rarely
buy a book. I suggested to one of our neighbors that
he might advantageously have given a certain son a
chance with books. “Don’t want no books,” was the
answer. “There’s enough goes to books! Get so lazy
after a while they won’t farm.” The winter is employed
partly in preparing material to fertilize the wheat-land
during the coming summer. Great droves of cattle and
sheep come down our road from the West, and our
farmers buy from these, and fatten stock during the
winter months for the Philadelphia market. A proper
care of his stock will occupy some portion of the farmer’s
time. A farmer’s son told me also of cutting wood and
quarrying stone in the winter, adding, “If a person
wouldn’t work in the winter, they’d be behindhand in
the spring.”</p>

<p>Besides these, the farmer has generally a great
“freundschaft,” or family connection, both his and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
wife’s; and the paying visits within a range of twenty
or thirty miles, and receiving visits in return, help to
pass away the time. Then Jacob and Susanna are actively
benevolent; they are liable to be called upon,
summer and winter, to wait on the sick and to help
bury the dead. Susanna was formerly renowned as a
baker at funerals, where her services were freely given.</p>

<p>This rich level land of ours is highly prized by the
“Dutch” for farming purposes, and the great demand
has enhanced the price. The farms, too, are small,
seventy acres being a fair size. When Seth R., the
rich preacher, bought his last farm from an “Englishman,”
William G. said to him, “Well, Seth, it seems as
if you Dutch folks had determined to root us English
out; but thee had to pay pretty dear for thy root this
time.”</p>

<p>There are some superstitious ideas that still hold sway
here, regarding the growth of plants. A young girl
coming to us for cabbage-plants said that it was a good
time to set them out, for “it was in the Wirgin.” It is
very doubtful whether she knew <i>what</i> was in Virgo, but I
suppose that it was the moon. So our farmer’s wife tells
me that the Virgin will do very well for cabbages, but
not for any plant like beans, for, though they will flower
well, they will not mature the fruit. Fence should be
set in the up-going of the moon; meat butchered in the
down-going will shrink in the pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<h3>FARMERS’ WIVES.</h3>

<p>One of my “Dutch” neighbors, who, from a shoemaker,
became the owner of two farms, said to me,
“The woman is more than half;” and his own very
laborious wife (with her portion) had indeed been so.</p>

<p>The woman (in common speech, “the old woman”)
milks, raises the poultry, has charge of the garden,—sometimes
digging the ground herself, and planting and
hoeing, with the assistance of her daughters and the
“maid,” when she has one. (German, <i>magd</i>.) To be
sure, she does not go extensively into vegetable-raising,
nor has she a large quantity of strawberries and other
small fruits; neither does she plant a great many peas
and beans, that are laborious to “stick.” She has a
quantity of cabbages and of “red beets,” of onions and
of early potatoes, in her garden, a plenty of cucumbers
for winter pickles, and store of string-beans and tomatoes,
with some sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>Peter R. told me that in one year, off their small
farm, they sold “two hundred dollars’ worth of <i>wedgable</i>
things, not counting the butter.” As in that year the
clothing for each member of the family probably cost no
more than fifteen dollars, the two hundred dollars’ worth
of vegetable things was of great importance.</p>

<p>Our “Dutch” never make <i>store</i>-cheese. At a county
fair, only one cheese was exhibited, and that was from
Chester County. The farmer’s wife boards all the
farm-hands, and the mechanics—the carpenter, mason,
etc.—who put up the new buildings, and the fence-makers.
At times she allows the daughters to go out and
husk corn. It was a pretty sight which I saw one fall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
day,—an Amish man with four sons and daughters,
husking in the field. “We do it all ourselves,” said he.</p>

<p>(Said a neighbor, “A man told me once that he was
at an Amish husking—a husking-match in the kitchen.
He said he never saw as much sport in all his life.
There they had the bloom-sock. There was one old man,
quite gray-headed, and gray-bearded; he laughed till
he shook.” Said another, “There’s not many huskings
going on now. The most play now goes on at the infares.”)</p>

<p>In winter mornings perhaps the farmer’s wife goes out
to milk in the stable with a lantern, while her daughters
get breakfast; has her house “redd up” about eight
o’clock, and is prepared for several hours’ sewing before
dinner, laying by great piles of shirts for summer. We
no longer make linen; but I have heard of one “Dutch”
girl who had a good supply of domestic linen made into
shirts and trousers for the future spouse whose fair proportions
she had not yet seen.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many garments to make in a
large family, but there is not much work put upon them.
We do not yet patronize the sewing-machine very extensively,
but a seamstress or tailoress is sometimes called
in. At the spring cleaning the labors of the women
folk are increased by whitewashing the picket-fences.</p>

<p>In March we make soap, before the labors of the
garden are great. The forests are being obliterated from
this fertile tract, and many use what some call <i>consecrated</i>
lye; formerly, the ash-hopper was filled, and a
good lot of egg-bearing lye run off to begin the soap
with, while the weaker filled the soft-soap kettle, after
the soap had “come.” The chemical operation of soap-making
often proved difficult, and, of course, much was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
said about luck. “We had bad luck making soap.” A
sassafras stick was preferred for stirring, and the soap
was stirred always in one direction. In regard to this,
and that other chemical operation, making and keeping
vinegar, there are certain ideas about the temporary incapacity
of some persons,—ideas only to be alluded to
here. If the farmer’s wife never “has luck” in making
soap, she employs some skilful woman to come in and
help her. It is not a long operation, for the “Dutch”
rush this work speedily. If the lye is well run off, two
tubs of hard soap and a barrel of soft can be made in a
day. A smart housekeeper can make a barrel of soap
in the morning, and go visiting in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Great are the household labors in harvest; but the
cooking and baking in the hot weather are cheerfully
done for the men, who are toiling in hot suns and stifling
barns. Four meals are common at this season, for “a
piece” is sent out at nine o’clock. I heard of one
“Dutch” girl’s making some fifty pies a week in harvest;
for if you have four meals a day, and pie at each, many
are required. We have great faith in pie.</p>

<p>I have been told of an inexperienced Quaker housewife
in the neighboring county of York, who was left in
charge of the farm, and during harvest these important
labors were performed by John Stein, John Stump, and
John Stinger. She also had guests, welcome perhaps as
“rain in harvest.” To conciliate the Johns was very
important, and she waited on them first. “What will
thee have, John Stein?” “What shall I give thee,
John Stump?” “And thee, John Stinger?” On one
memorable occasion there was mutiny in the field, for
John Stein declared that he never worked where there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
were not “kickelin” cakes in harvest, nor would he now.
<i>Küchlein</i> proved to be cakes fried in fat; and the housewife
was ready to appease “Achilles’ wrath,” as soon as
she made this discovery.</p>

<p>We made in one season six barrels of cider into apple-butter,
three at a time. Two large copper kettles were
hung under the beech-trees, down between the spring-house
and smoke-house, and the cider was boiled down
the evening before, great stumps of trees being in demand.
One hand watched the cider, and the rest of the
family gathered in the kitchen and labored diligently in
preparing the cut apples, so that in the morning the
“schnits” might be ready to go in. (<i>Schneiden</i>, to cut,
<i>geschnitten</i>.)</p>

<p>One bushel and a half of cut apples are said to be
enough for a barrel of cider. In a few hours the apples
will all be in, and then you will stir, and stir, and stir,
for you do not want to have the apple-butter burn at
the bottom, and be obliged to dip it out into tubs and
scour the kettle. Some time in the afternoon, you will
take out a little on a dish, and when you find that the
cider no longer “weeps out” round the edges, but all
forms a simple heap, you will dip it up into earthen
vessels, and when cold take it “on” to the garret to keep
company with the hard soap and the bags of dried apples
and cherries, perhaps with the hams and shoulders. Soap
and apple-butter are usually made in an open fireplace,
where hangs the kettle. At one time (about the year
1828) I have heard that there was apple-butter in the
Lancaster Museum which dated from Revolutionary
times; for we do not expect it to ferment in the summer.
It dries away; but water is stirred in to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
it for the table. Sometimes peach-butter is made, with
cider, molasses, or sugar, and, in the present scarcity of
apples, cut pumpkin is often put into the apple-butter.</p>

<p>Soon after apple-butter-making comes butchering, for
we like an early pig in the fall, when the store of
smoked meat has run out. Pork is the staple, and we
smoke the flitches, not preserving them in brine like the
Yankees. We ourselves use much beef, and do not like
smoked flitch, but I speak for the majority. Sausage is
a great dish with us, as in Germany.</p>

<p>Butchering is one of the many occasions for the display
of friendly feeling, when brother or father steps
in to help hang the hogs, or a sister to assist in rendering
lard, or in preparing a plentiful meal. An active
farmer will have two or three porkers killed, scalded,
and hung up by sunrise, and by night the whole operation
of sausage and “pudding” making, and lard rendering,
will be finished, and the house set in order. The
friends who have assisted receive a portion of the sausage,
etc., which portion is called the “metzel-sup” (or soop).
The metzel-sup is very often sent to poor widows and
others.</p>

<p><i>We</i> make scrapple from the skin, a part of the livers,
and heads, with the addition of corn-meal; but, instead,
our “Dutch” neighbors make <i>liverwurst</i> (“woorsht”), or
meat pudding, omitting the meal, and this compound,
stuffed into the larger entrails, is very popular in Lancaster
market. Some make <i>pawn-haus</i> from the liquor
in which the pudding-meat was boiled, adding thereto
corn-meal. The name is properly <i>pann-haas</i>, and signifies,
perhaps, panned-rabbit. It is sometimes made
of richer material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>These three dishes, just before mentioned, are fried
before eating. I have never seen hog’s-head cheese in
“Dutch” houses. If the boiling-pieces of beef are kept
over summer, they are smoked, instead of being preserved
in brine. Much smear-case (<i>schmier-käse</i>), or
cottage cheese, is eaten in these regions. Children, and
some grown people too, fancy it upon bread with molasses;
which may be considered as an offset to the Yankee
pork and molasses.</p>

<p>In some Pennsylvania families smear-case and apple-butter
are eaten to save butter, which is a salable article.
The true “Dutch” housewife’s ambition is to supply the
store-goods for the family as far as possible from the sale
of the butter and eggs.</p>

<p>We have also Dutch cheese, which may be made by
crumbling the dry smear-case, working in butter, salt,
and chopped sage, forming it into pats, and setting them
away to ripen. The <i>sieger-käse</i> is made from sweet milk
boiled, with sour milk added and beaten eggs, and then
set to drain off the whey. (<i>Ziegen-käse</i> is German for
goat’s milk cheese.)</p>

<p>“Schnits and knep” is said to be made of dried apples,
fat pork, and dough-dumplings cooked together.</p>

<p>“Tell them they’re good,” says one of my “Dutch”
acquaintances.</p>

<p>Knep is from the German, <i>knöpfe</i>, buttons or knobs.
In common speech the word has fallen to nep. The
“nep” are sometimes made from pie-crust, or sometimes
from a batter of eggs and milk, and may be boiled without
the meat; but one of my acquaintances says that the
smoke gives a peculiar and appetizing flavor.</p>

<p>Apple-dumplings in “Dutch” are <i>aepel-dumplins</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
whence I infer that like <i>pye-kroosht</i> they are not of
German origin.</p>

<p>In the fall our “Dutch” make <i>sauer-kraut</i>. I happened
to visit the house of my friend Susanna when her
husband and son were going to take an hour at noon to
help her with the kraut. Two white tubs stood upon
the back porch, one with the fair round heads, and the
other to receive the cabbage when cut by a knife set in
a board (a very convenient thing for cutting kohl-slaw
and cucumbers). When cut, the cabbage is packed into
a “stand” with a sauer-kraut staff, resembling the
pounder with which New Englanders beat clothes in a
barrel. Salt is added during the packing. When the
cabbage ferments it becomes acid. The kraut-stand remains
in the cellar; the contents not being unpalatable
when boiled with potatoes and the chines or ribs of pork.
But the smell of the boiling kraut is very strong, and
that stomach is probably strong which readily digests
the meal.</p>

<p>Sometimes “nep” or dumplings are boiled with the
salt meat and sour-krout. A young teacher, who was
speaking of sour-krout and nep, was asked how he spelt
this word. He did not know, and said he did not care,
so he got the nep.</p>

<p>“As Dutch as sour-krout,” has become a familiar saying
here. In Lehigh County, if I mistake not, I heard
the common dialect called “sour-krout Dutch.”</p>

<p>Our “Dutch” make soup in variety, and pronounce
the word short, between <i>soup</i> and <i>sup</i>. Thus there is
Dutch soup, potato soup, etc.; scalded milk and bread is
“bread and milk soup,” bread crumbed into coffee
“coffee soup.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Noodel soup (<i>nudeln</i>) is a treat. Noodels may be
called domestic macaroni. I have seen a dish in which
bits of fried bread were laid upon the piled-up noodels,
to me unpalatable from the quantity of eggs in the latter.</p>

<p>Dampf-noodles, or <i>gedämpfte nudeln</i>, are boiled, and
melted butter is poured over them.</p>

<p>The extremely popular cakes, twisted, sprinkled with
salt, and baked crisp and brown, called pretzels (<i>brezeln</i>),
were known in Pennsylvania long before the cry for
“ein lager, zwei brezeln” (a glass of lager and two
pretzels), was heard in the land.</p>

<p>One of my “Dutch” neighbors, who visited Western
New York, was detained several hours at Elmira.
“They hadn’t no water-crackers out there,” he complained.
“Didn’t know what you meant when you said
water-crackers; and they hain’t got pretzels. You can’t
get no pretzels.”</p>

<p>Perhaps not at the railroad stations.</p>

<p>We generally find excellent home-made wheat bread
in this limestone region. We make the pot of “sots”
(or rising) overnight, with boiled mashed potatoes,
scalded flour, and sometimes hops. Friday is baking-day.
The “Dutch” housewife is very fond of baking
in the brick oven, but the scarcity of wood must gradually
accustom us to the great cooking-stove.</p>

<p>One of the heavy labors of the fall is the fruit-drying.
Afterward your hostess invites you to partake, thus:
“Mary, will you have pie? This is snits, and this is
elder” (or dried apples, and dried elderberries). Dried
peaches are peach snits.</p>

<p>A laboring woman once, speaking to me of a neighbor,
said, “She hain’t got many dried apples. If her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
girl would snits in the evening, as I did!—but she’d
rather keep company and run around than to snits.”</p>

<p>The majority keep one fire in winter. This is in the
kitchen, which with nice housekeepers is the abode of
neatness, with its rag carpet and brightly polished stove.
An adjoining room or building is the wash-house, where
butchering, soap-making, etc., are done by the help of
a great kettle hung in the fireplace, not set in brick-work.</p>

<p>Adjoining the kitchen, on another side, is a state
apartment, also rag-carpeted, and called “the room.”
The stove-pipe from the kitchen sometimes passes
through the ceiling, and tempers the sleeping-room of
the parents. These arrangements are not very favorable
to bathing in cold weather; indeed, to wash the
whole person is not very common, in summer or in
winter.</p>

<p>Will you go up-stairs in a neat Dutch farm-house?
Here are rag carpets again. Gay quilts are on the best
beds, where green and red calico, perhaps in the form
of a basket, are displayed on a white ground; or the
beds bear brilliant coverlets of red, white, and blue, as
if to “make the rash gazer wipe his eye.” The common
pillow-cases are sometimes of blue check, or of
calico. In winter, people often sleep under feather-covers,
not so heavy as a feather-bed. In the spring
there is a great washing of bedclothes, and then the
blankets are washed, which during winter supplied the
place of sheets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<h3>HOLIDAYS.</h3>

<p>I was sitting alone, one Christmas time, when the
door opened and there entered some half-dozen youths
or men, who frightened me so that I slipped out at the
door. They, being thus alone, and not intending any
harm, at once left. These, I suppose, were Christmas
mummers, though I heard them called “bell-schnickel.”</p>

<p>At another time, as I was sitting with my little boy,
Aunt Sally came in smiling and mysterious, and took
her place by the stove. Immediately after, there entered
a man in disguise, who very much alarmed my little Dan.</p>

<p>The stranger threw down nuts and cakes, and, when
some one offered to pick them up, struck at him with a
rod. This was the real bell-schnickel, personated by the
farmer.</p>

<p>It will hardly be supposed that Bell-schnickel and
Santa Claus are the same; but the former is Peltz-nickel<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
or Nicholas dressed in fur. St. Nicholas’ day, the 6th
of December, is in Advent.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning the cry is, “Christmas-gift!”
and not, as elsewhere, “A merry Christmas!” Christmas
is a day when people do not work, but go to meeting,
when roast turkey and mince-pie are in order, and
when the “Dutch” housewife has store of cakes on hand
to give to the little folks.</p>

<p>We still hear of barring-out at Christmas. The pupils
fasten themselves in the school-house, and keep the
teacher out to obtain presents from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>The first of April (which our neighbors generally call
Aprile) is a great occasion. This is the opening of the
farming year. The tenant farmers and other “renters”
move to their new homes, and interest-money and other
debts are due; and so much money changes hands in
Lancaster, on the first, that pickpockets are attracted
thither, and the unsuspicious “Dutch” farmer sometimes
finds himself a loser.</p>

<p>The movings, on or about the first, are made festive
occasions; neighbors, young and old, are gathered; some
bring wagons to transport farm utensils and furniture,
others assist in driving cattle, put furniture in its place,
and set up bedsteads; while the women are ready to
help prepare the bountiful meal. At this feast I have
heard a worthy tenant farmer say, “Now help yourselves,
as you did out there” (with the goods).</p>

<p>Whitsuntide Monday is a great holiday with the young
“Dutch” folks. It occurs when there is a lull in farm-work,
between corn-planting and hay-making. Now
the new summer bonnets are all in demand, and the
taverns are found full of youths and girls, who sometimes
walk the street hand-in-hand, eat cakes and drink
beer, or visit the “flying horses.” A number of seats
are arranged around a central pole, and, a pair taking
each seat, the whole revolves by the work of a horse,
and you can have a circular ride for six cents.</p>

<p>On the Fourth of July we are generally at work in
the harvest-field. Several of the festivals of the church
are held here as days of rest, if not of recreation. Such
are Good Friday, Ascension-day, etc. On Easter, eggs
colored and otherwise ornamented were formerly much
in vogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>Thanksgiving is beginning to be observed here, but
the New Englander would miss the family gatherings,
the roast turkeys, the pumpkin-pies. Possibly we go to
church in the morning, and sit quiet for the rest of the
day; and as for pumpkin-pies, we do not greatly fancy
them. Raisin-pie, or mince-pie, we can enjoy.</p>

<p>The last night of October is “Hallow-eve.” I was
in Lancaster one Hallow-eve, and boys were ringing
door-bells, carrying away door-steps, throwing corn at
the windows, or running off with an unguarded wagon.
I heard of one or two youngsters who had requested an
afternoon holiday to go to church, but who had spent
their time in going out of town to steal corn for this
occasion. In the country, farm-gates are taken from
their hinges and removed; and it was formerly a favorite
amusement to take a wagon to pieces, and, after carrying
the parts up to the barn-roof, to put it together
again, thus obliging the owner to take it apart and bring
it down. Such “tricks” as are described by Burns in
the poem of “Hallow-e’en” may be heard of occasionally,
continued perhaps by the Scotch-Irish element in
our population.</p>

<h3>PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>Over twenty years ago I was circulating an anti-slavery
petition among women. I carried it to the
house of a neighboring farmer, who was a miller also,
and well to do. His wife signed the petition (<i>all</i> women
did not in those days), but she signed it with her mark.
I have understood that it is about twenty years since the
school law was made universal here, and that our township
of Upper Leacock wanted to resist by litigation the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
establishment of public schools.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is the school-tax
that is onerous. Within about twenty years a great
impetus has been given to education by the establishment
of the county superintendency, of normal schools,
and of teachers’ institutes. I think it is within this
time, however, that the board of directors met, in an
adjoining township, and, being called upon to vote by
ballot, there were afterward found in the box several
different ways of spelling the word “no.”</p>

<p>At the last institute, a worthy young man at the blackboard
was telling the teachers how to make their pupils
pronounce the word “did,” which they inclined to call
<i>dit</i>; and a young woman told me that she found it
necessary, when teaching in Berks County, to practise
speaking “Dutch,” in order to make the pupils understand
their lessons. It must be rather hard to hear and
talk “Dutch” almost constantly, and then to go to a
school where the text-books are English.</p>

<p>There is still an effort made to have German taught
in our public schools. The reading of German is considered
a great accomplishment, and is one required for
a candidate for the ministry among some of our plainer
sects. But the teacher is generally overburdened in the
winter with the necessary branches in a crowded, ungraded
school. Our township generally has school for
seven months in the year; some townships have only
five; and in Berks County I have heard of one having
only four months. About thirty-five dollars a month is
paid to teachers, male and female.</p>

<p>My little boy of seven began to go to public school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
this fall. For a while I could hear him repeating such
expressions as, “Che, double o, t, coot” (meaning good).
“P-i-g, pick.” “Kreat A, little A, pouncing P.” “I
don’t like chincherpread.” Even among our “Dutch”
people of more culture, <i>etch</i> is heard for <i>aitch</i> (h), and
<i>chay</i> for jay (j), and these are relics of early training.</p>

<p>The standard of our county superintendent is high
(1868), and his examinations are severe. His salary is
about seventeen hundred dollars. Where there is so
much wealth as here, it seems almost impossible that
learning should not follow, as soon as the minds of the
people are turned toward it; but the great fear of
making their children “lazy” operates against sending
them to school. Industrious habits will certainly tend
more to the pecuniary success of a farmer than the “art
of writing and speaking the English language <i>correctly</i>.”</p>

<h3>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p>My dear old “English” friend, Samuel G., had often
been asked to stay and eat with David B., and on one
occasion he concluded to accept the invitation. They
went to the table, and had a silent pause; then David
cut up the meat, and each workman or member of the
family put in a fork and helped himself. The guest
was discomfited, and, finding that he was likely to lose
his dinner otherwise, he followed their example. The
invitation to eat had covered the whole. When guests
are present, many say, “Now help yourselves;” but
they do not use vain repetitions, as the city people do.</p>

<p>Coffee is still drunk three times a day in some families,
but frequently without sugar. The sugar-bowl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
stands on the table, with spoons therein for those who
want sugar; but at a late “home-coming” party I
believe that I was the only one at the table who took
sugar. The dishes of smear-case, molasses, apple-butter,
etc., are not always supplied with spoons. <i>We</i> dip in
our knives, and with the same useful implements convey
the food to our mouths. Does the opposite extreme prevail
among the farmers of Massachusetts? Do they
always eat with their forks, and use napkins?</p>

<p>On many busy farm-occasions, the woman of the house
will find it more convenient to let the men eat first,—to
get the burden of the harvest-dinner off her mind and
her hands, and then sit down with her daughters, her
“maid” and little children, to their own repast. But
the allowing to the men the constant privilege of eating
first has passed away, if indeed it ever prevailed. At
funeral feasts the old men and women sit down first,
with the mourning family. Then succeed the second,
third, and fourth tables.</p>

<p>Among the children of well-to-do parents, the unmarried
daughter will sometimes go into the service of the
married one, receiving wages regularly, or allowing them
to accumulate. An acquaintance of mine in Lancaster
had a hired girl living in his family who was worth
twelve thousand dollars in cash means, her father having
been a rich farmer. Among our plain farmers, such
persons are considered more praiseworthy than the
reverse.</p>

<p>I lately asked a lawyer in Northampton County why
certain persons had allowed the Lutheran and Reformed
farmers, men of very little school learning, to outstrip
them in the pursuit of wealth. He answered that all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the tendency of the education of these last was saving.
“In old times,” he continued, “when we had no ranges
nor cooking-stoves, but a fire on the hearth, I used to
hear my mother say to her daughters that they must not
let the dish-water boil, or they would not be married for
seven years.” On the same principle, when a young
“English” girl whom I knew told a young “Dutchman”
that she was going to make bread, he said, “I’m coming
for a handful of your dough-trough scrapings;” the idea
being that there should be no scrapings left.</p>

<p>Mr. S., of Lehigh County, says, “We make money
in Pennsylvania by saving; in New York, they make
money by paying out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. E., of the same county, says, “We Pennsylvanians
are brought up to work in the house and to family
affairs, but the Eastern girls are brought up more in the
factories, and they don’t know anything about housework.
Many have been married, and lived here in this
town (Allentown), of whom I have heard speak, who
have not lived happily, because they were not used to
keep house in the way that their husbands had been accustomed
to. They were very intelligent, but not accustomed
to work, and their families would get poor,
and stay poor.” Mrs. R.’s daughter added, that “the
New England men, the Eastern men, milk and do all
the outside work.”</p>

<p>The writer thinks, nevertheless, that New England
women will not be willing to admit that they do not understand
housework, and are not eminently “faculized.”</p>

<p>We Lancaster “Dutch” are always striving to seize
Time’s forelock. We rise, even in the winter, about
four, feed the stock while the women get breakfast, eat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
breakfast in the short days by coal-oil lamps, and by
daylight are ready for the operations of the day. The
English folks and the backsliding “Dutch” are sometimes
startled when they hear their neighbors blow the
horn or ring the bell for dinner. On a recent pleasant
October day the farmer’s wife was churning out-of-doors,
and cried, “Why, there’s the dinner-bells a’ready.
Mercy days!” I went in to the clock, and found it at
twenty minutes of eleven. The “Dutch” farmers almost
invariably keep their time half an hour or more
ahead, like that village in Cornwall where it was twelve
o’clock when it was but half-past eleven to the rest of
the world. Our “Dutch” are never seen running to
catch a railroad train.</p>

<p>We are not a total-abstinence people. Before these
times of high prices, liquor was often furnished to hands
in the harvest-field.</p>

<p>A few years ago a meeting was held in a neighboring
school-house to discuss a prohibitory liquor law. After
various speeches the question was put to the vote, thus:
“All those who want leave to drink whiskey will please
to rise.” “Now all those who don’t want to drink
whiskey will rise.” The affirmative had a decided majority.</p>

<p>Work is a cardinal virtue with the “Dutchman.”
“He is lazy,” is a very opprobrious remark. At the
quilting, when I was trying to take out one of the
screws, Katy Groff, who is sixty-five, exclaimed, “How
lazy I am, not to be helping you!” (“<i>Wie ich bin faul.</i>”)</p>

<p>Marriages sometimes take place between the two nationalities;
but I do not think the “Dutch” farmers
desire English wives for their sons, unless the wives are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
decidedly rich. On the other hand, I heard of an
English farmer’s counselling his son to seek a “Dutch”
wife. When the son had wooed and won his substantial
bride, “Now he will see what good cooking is,” said a
“Dutch” girl to me. I was surprised at the remark, for
his mother was an excellent housekeeper.</p>

<p>The circus is the favorite amusement of our people.
Lancaster papers have often complained of the slender
attendance which is bestowed upon lectures and the like;
even theatrical performances are found “slow,” compared
with the feats of the ring.</p>

<p>Our “Dutch” use a freedom of language that is not
known to the English, and which to them savors of
coarseness. “But they mean no harm by it,” says one
of my English friends. It is difficult to practise reserve
where the whole family sit in one heated room.
This rich limestone land in which the “Dutch” delight
is nearly level to an eye trained among the hills. Do
hills make a people more poetical or imaginative?</p>

<p>Perhaps so; but there is vulgarity too among the
hills.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing article was written about fourteen years
ago, and appeared (with perhaps some small changes) in
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for October, 1869. It was published
in the first edition of this work in 1872, and in
the second edition in 1874. Many of the alterations
which were made in one or both of these editions are
now removed to the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>, where will also be found
additional matter on similar subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>The passage of over twelve years has considerably
changed the neighborhood in which I live. The greatest
differences are the rise in the value of land; the
division into smaller farms; the general introduction of
the culture of tobacco; and the change in the population
by the coming in of a larger number of that plainest
sect of Mennonites, called Amish.</p>

<p>As regards the rise in the value of land, it is doubtless
in part apparent only, from the greater amount of
money at this time. I have spoken of one who said,
“Well, Seth, it seems as if you Dutch folks had determined
to root us English out; but thee had to pay
pretty dear for thy root this time.” The farm alluded
to was sold about 1855, and brought less than one
hundred and sixty-three dollars per acre,—there being
one hundred and ten acres. It has since been divided,
and eighty acres, now a very large farm here, with the
newer farm buildings, it is supposed would now bring
over two hundred and fifty dollars. Small properties
sell much higher in proportion. I hear of twenty acres,
with fair farm buildings, having sold last fall for nine
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The division into smaller farms is caused in a great
measure by the Amish increasing and dividing properties
among their children, so that farms are running as
low, in many cases, as from twenty-five down to ten
acres. It is rare for the Amish to remain unmarried.
The owners of such small properties cannot afford to
hire help; the Amish help one another, and are willing
to help others also. Many acts of neighborly kindness
are exchanged here, even to giving a sick neighbor several
days’ work in the harvest-field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>Tobacco was cultivated to profit long ago on farms
and islands lying on the Susquehanna; but one of the
consequences of the civil war was to make the cultivation
of the weed more general here, and the immense
sums obtained for fine crops have also kept up the value
of this land.</p>

<p>The routine of farming described in the foregoing
article is now abandoned. The following are the crops
raised lately on a farm visible from where I write,—a
farm that has been for years under excellent cultivation.
It contains sixty-eight acres, of which (in round numbers)
twenty-six are in wheat, eighteen in Indian corn,
eleven in grass, six in tobacco, three-quarters of an acre
in potatoes, and the remainder is occupied by garden,
orchard, and buildings. Oats has not been grown on
this farm for six years. The ground is so rich that oats
lodge or fall, and will not mature the grain. For the
last four years wheat has averaged thirty bushels to the
acre. During the same time Indian corn has averaged
about fifty-five bushels. To speak slang, it is not one
of our brag crops. One year the cut-worms took two-thirds
of it on the farm mentioned; and this had to be
replanted. The greatest crop of corn of which I hear
mention on this farm was grown some years ago, and
was nine hundred bushels on ten acres.</p>

<p>As regards grass, the owner estimates that for the last
four years they have made on an average nearly three
tons of hay to the acre; last year they had thirty-six
tons on ten acres.</p>

<p>Of the six acres in tobacco this year, they prepare the
whole for planting, but only plant two themselves, giving
out four to others. The men who take this land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
plant and cultivate it, and receive one-half of the produce,
not being charged for the preparation of the
ground, nor for taking the crop to market. One of the
advantages of the cultivation of tobacco (I am sensible
of its disadvantages, and do not recommend its use) is
that it gives the poor laboring man and woman more
independence. He or she takes an acre or more, plants,
waters, destroys the large tobacco-worm, strips off the
suckers, tops it, breaks down the flowering stem, gathers,
dries, sorts, and packs, and receives perhaps one hundred
dollars per acre in lump, which is very acceptable. They
estimate that they make about double wages.</p>

<p>The eight-horse threshers before mentioned are getting
out of date; steam threshes now almost entirely,
and completes the work on such a farm as just described
in two days. The threshing is frequently finished as
early as the first of September, so that the farmer can
hang tobacco in the barn. Large tobacco-houses have
also been erected, in the cellar of which this crop is prepared
for sale.</p>

<p>It will be observed that very little attention was paid
to potatoes. Last year they brought at the rate of two
hundred bushels to the acre. We had a pretty severe
drought in 1881, and potatoes have sold this winter at
one dollar per bushel, which would make the potato
crop superior in value to the tobacco.</p>

<p>The great amount of manure required to keep the land
up to such a standard is thus supplied on this farm,
which is a model one in the neighborhood. For several
months last winter the owner had sixteen horses, five of
his own and the rest boarding; he also had twelve head
of horned cattle, and fattened nine swine. All the corn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
hay, and fodder raised on the farm were fed upon it.
(Straw is rarely fed here.) Besides, the farmer bought
five tons of Western mill-feed (the bran and other refuse
from wheat flour) and about three hundred bushels of
corn. This spring he has bought two tons of a certain
fertilizer for his corn, and applied his own barn-yard
manure to the tobacco and wheat. He has been indemnified
in part for the great amount fed, by the money
received for boarding horses at twelve dollars apiece by
the month. Horses from Canada and the West are often
fattened here for the Eastern market. This farmer
bought two last year, worked them himself on the farm,
fattened and groomed them, and sold them so as to make
one hundred dollars apiece on them; but this was exceptional.</p>

<p>Besides the fertilizers before mentioned, lime is used
in this region, although some have doubted the necessity
of applying it to our rich limestone land. On the farm
which I have been describing it is put on about every
sixth year, at the rate of six hundred bushels on eleven
acres. It costs ten cents a bushel.</p>

<p class="tb">Another change here is that many now buy bread,
and several bakers regularly supply the neighborhood.
This has caused a great lightening of the labor at funerals.
The bread and rusks (or buns) are bought and
the pies dispensed with, which were once considered so
necessary. A jocose youth in a near village used to say,
“There will be raisin-pie there,” when he wished to express
that there was fatal illness; but raisin-pies are no
longer so fashionable at funerals. There is no diminution,
however, in the great gatherings. A wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
farmer died lately who was also a Mennonite preacher.
The funeral was on Sunday; the guests heard preaching
at the house, then dined, and the funeral went to the
church, where was preaching again. Four hundred carriages,
it is said, were on the ground.</p>

<p>Our school-term in this district is not increased beyond
seven months; but the salary has risen, and is
from thirty-five to forty dollars per month, according to
merit.</p>

<p>The Amish in this immediate neighborhood still cling
to the plain customs I have described, except that it has
become quite common for young people to drive in simple
buggies. Now the yellow-covered wagons are not
so universal; other colors are also used, and more elegant
harness. (They generally keep very good harness.)
Neither do the young men wear their hair to their
shoulders. Many of the Amish now wear suspenders.
One of my friends, who is Amish, says that you cannot
speak of any such rule as regards the church in general,
for every congregation has its own rules in these minor
affairs.</p>

<p>The family graveyard, especially mentioned, has been
removed, and all the bodies that were recovered interred
at the Mennonite church in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="tb">Two or three small changes in this neighborhood are
the following: Sewing-machines are now found here in
great numbers; many houses have large stoves, which
heat at least one room up-stairs; and it is not common
in this immediate neighborhood to sit up with the dead,
in the manner before described.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_AMISH_MEETING">AN AMISH MEETING.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>

</div>

<p>It was on a Sunday morning in March, when the air
was bleak and the roads were execrable, that I obtained
a driver to escort me to the farm-house where an Amish
meeting was to be held.</p>

<p>It was a little after nine o’clock when I entered, and,
although the hour was so early, I found the congregation
nearly all gathered, and the preaching begun.</p>

<p>There were forty men present, as many women, and
one infant. Had the weather been less inclement, we
should probably have had more little ones, for such
plain people do not think it necessary to leave the babies
at home.</p>

<p>The rooms in which we sat seemed to have been constructed
for these great occasions. They were the kitchen
and “the room,”—as our people call the sitting-room,
or best room,—and were so arranged as to be made into
one by means of two doors.</p>

<p>Our neighbors wore the usual costume of the sect,
which is a branch of the Mennonite Society, or nearly
allied to it, the men having laid off their round-crowned
and remarkably wide-brimmed hats. Their hair is
usually cut square across the forehead, and hangs long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
behind; their coats are plainer than those of the plainest
Quaker, and are fastened, except the overcoat, with
hooks and eyes in place of buttons; whence they are
sometimes called Hooker or Hook-and-Eye Mennists.
The pantaloons are worn without suspenders. Formerly
the Amish were often called “beardy men,” but
since beards have become fashionable theirs are not so
conspicuous.</p>

<p>The women, whom I have sometimes seen with a
bright purple apron, an orange neckerchief, or some
other striking bit of color, were now more soberly arrayed
in plain white caps without ruffle or border, and
white neckerchiefs, though occasionally a cap or kerchief
was black. They wear closely fitting waists, with a
little basquine behind, which is probably a relic from
the times of the short gown and petticoat. Their gowns
were of sober woollen stuff, frequently of flannel; and
all wore aprons.</p>

<p>But the most surprising figures among the Amish are
the little children, dressed in garments like those of old
persons. It has been my lot to see at the house of her
parents a tender little dark-eyed Amish maiden of three
years, old enough to begin to speak “Dutch,” and as
yet ignorant of English. Seated upon her father’s lap,
sick and suffering, with that sweet little face encircled
by the plain muslin cap, the little figure dressed in that
plain gown, she was one not to be soon forgotten. But
the little girl that was at meeting to-day was either no
Amish child or a great backslider, for she was hardly
to be distinguished in dress from the “world’s people.”</p>

<p>The floors were bare, but on one of the open doors
hung a long white towel, worked at one end with colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
figures, such as our mothers or grandmothers put upon
samplers. These perhaps were meant for flowers. The
congregation sat principally on benches. On the men’s
side a small shelf of books ran around one corner of the
room.</p>

<p>The preacher, who was speaking when I entered, continued
for about fifteen minutes. His remarks and the
rest of the services were in “Dutch.” I have been
criticised for applying the epithet to my neighbors, or
to their language, but “Dutch” is the title which they
generally apply to themselves, speaking of “us Dutch
folks and you English folks,” and sometimes with a
pretty plain hint that some of the “Dutch” ways are
discreeter and better, if not more virtuous, than the
English. But, though I call them “Dutch,” I am fully
aware that they are not Hollanders. Most of them are
Swiss, of ancient and honorable descent, exiles on account
of religious persecution.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I do not understand the language
well enough to give a sketch of some of the discourses
on this occasion. At times I understood an expression
of the first speaker, such as “Let us well reflect and
observe,” or “Let us well consider,” expressions that
were often repeated. As he was doubtless a farmer, and
was speaking extemporaneously, it is not remarkable
that they were so.</p>

<p>When the preacher had taken his seat, the congregation
knelt for five minutes in silence. A brother then
read aloud from the German Bible, concerning Nicodemus
who came to Jesus by night, etc. After this
another brother rose and spoke in a tone like that which
is so common among Friends, namely, a kind of singing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
or chanting tone, which he accompanied by a little
gesture.</p>

<p>While he was speaking, one or two women went out,
and, as I wished to take note of the proceedings, I
followed them into the wash-house or outside kitchen,
which was quite comfortable. As I passed along, I saw
in the yard the wagons which had brought the people
to meeting. Most of them were covered with plain
yellow oil-cloth. I have been told that there are sometimes
a hundred wagons gathered at one farm-house,
and that in summer the meetings are often held in
barns.</p>

<p>I sat down by the stove in the wash-house, and a
very kindly old woman, the host’s mother, came and
renewed the fire. As she did not talk English, I spoke
to her a little in German, and she seemed to understand
me. When I wrote, she wondered and laughed at my
rapid movements, for writing is slower work with these
people than some other kinds of labor. I suppose, indeed,
that there are still some of the older women who
scarcely know how to write.</p>

<p>I asked her whether after meeting I might look at
the German books on the corner shelf,—ancient books
with dark leather covers and metallic clasps. She said
in reply, “Bleibsht esse?” (“Shall you stay and eat?”)
Yes, I would. “Ya wohl,” said she, “kannst.” (“Very
well, you can.”)</p>

<p>A neat young Amish woman, the “maid” or housekeeper,
came and put upon the stove a great tin wash-boiler,
shining bright, into which she put water for
making coffee and for washing dishes.</p>

<p>I soon returned to the meeting, and found the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
preacher still speaking. I suppose that he had continued
during my absence, and, if so, his discourse was
an hour and ten minutes in length. This was quite too
long to be entertaining to one who only caught the sense
of an occasional passage, or of a few texts of Scripture.
It was while these monotonous tones continued that I
heard a rocking upon the floor overhead. It proceeded,
I believe, from the young mother,—the mother of the
little one before spoken of. When the child had become
restless before this, or when she was tired, a young man
upon the brethren’s side of the room had taken it for
a while, and now it was doubtless being put to sleep in a
room overhead, into which a stove-pipe passed from the
apartment where we sat.</p>

<p>My attention was also attracted by an old lady who
sat near me, and facing the stove, with her hands crossed
in her lap, and a gold or brass ring on each middle
finger. She wore a black flannel dress and a brown
woollen apron, leather shoes and knit woollen stockings.
Her head was bent forward toward her broad bosom,
upon which was crossed a white kerchief. With her
gray hair, round face, and plain linen cap, her whole
figure reminded me of the peasant women of continental
Europe or of a Flemish picture.</p>

<p>I have spoken of her wearing rings. Says one of my
neighbors of a different Mennist sect, “Were they not
brass? She wears them for some sickness, I reckon.
She would not wear them for show. One of our preachers
wears steel rings on his little fingers for cramps.”</p>

<p>When the long sermon was ended, different brethren
were called upon, and during a half-hour we had from
them several short discourses, one or two of them nearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
inaudible. The speakers were, I think, giving their
views on what had been said, or perhaps they were by
these little efforts preparing themselves to become preachers,
or showing their gifts to the congregation.</p>

<p>It is stated in Herzog’s Cyclopædia that among the
Mennonites in Holland the number of <i>liebesprediger</i> has
greatly declined, so that some congregations had no
preacher. (The word <i>liebesprediger</i> I am inclined to
translate as voluntary, unpaid preachers, like those
among Friends.) I am in doubt, indeed, whether any
such are now found in Holland. There seems to be no
scarcity in this country of preachers, who are, however,
in some, if not all three of the divisions of Mennonites,
chosen by lot.</p>

<p>When these smaller efforts were over, the former
preacher spoke again for twenty minutes, and several
of the women were moved to tears. After this the congregation
knelt in vocal prayer. When they rose, the
preacher said that the next meeting would be at the
house of John Lapp, in two weeks. He pronounced a
benediction, ending with the name of Jesus, and the
whole congregation, brethren and sisters, curtsied, or
made a reverence, as the French express it. This was
doubtless in allusion to the text, that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow. Finally, a hymn, or a
portion of one, was sung, drawn out in a peculiar manner
by dwelling on the words. I obtained a hymn-book,
and copied a portion. It seems obscure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Der Schopfer auch der Vater heisst,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Durch Christum, seinen Sohne;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Da wirket mit der Heilig Geist,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Irdisch verschmacht aus ganzen Muth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Der Vater sich ihm schenket.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The book from which I copied these lines was in
large German print, and bore the date 1785. In front
was this inscription in the German tongue and handwriting:
“This song-book belongs to me, Joseph B⸺.
Written in the year of Christ 1791; and I received it
from my father.” Both father and son have been gathered
to their fathers; the book, if I mistake not, was in
the house of the grandson, and it may yet outlast several
generations of these primitive people.</p>

<p>The services closed at a little after noon. From their
having been conducted entirely in German, or in German
and the dialect, some persons might suppose that these
were recent immigrants to our country. But the B.
family just alluded to was one of the first Amish families
that came here, having arrived in 1737.</p>

<p>It seems that the language is cherished with care, as a
means of preserving their religious and other peculiarities.
The public schools, however, which are almost
entirely English, must be a powerful means of assimilation.</p>

<p>The services being ended, the women quietly busied
themselves (while I wrote) in preparing dinner. In a
very short time two tables were spread in the apartment
where the meeting had been held. Two tables, I have
said,—and there was one for the men to sit at,—but on
the women’s side the <i>table</i> was formed of benches placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
together, and of course was quite low. I should have
supposed that this was a casual occurrence, had not an
acquaintance told me that many years ago, when she
attended an Amish meeting, she sat up to two benches.</p>

<p>Before eating there was a silent pause, during which
those men who had not yet a place at the table stood
uncovered reverentially, holding their hats before their
faces. In about fifteen minutes the “first table” had
finished eating, and another silent pause was observed in
the same manner before they rose.</p>

<p>I was invited to the second table, where I found
beautiful white bread, butter, pies, pickles, apple-butter,
and refined molasses. I observed that there were no
spoons in the molasses and apple-butter. A cup of
coffee also was handed to each person who wished it.
We were not invited to take more than one.</p>

<p>This meal marks the progress of wealth and luxury,
or the decline of asceticism, since the day when bean
soup was the principal, if not the only, dish furnished
on these occasions. The same neighbor who told me
of sitting up to two benches, many years ago, told me
that at that time they were served with bean soup in
bright dishes, doubtless of pewter or tin. Three or
four persons ate out of one dish. It was very unhandy,
she said.</p>

<p>But while thus sketching the manners of my simple,
plain neighbors, let me not forget to acknowledge that
ready hospitality which thus provides a comfortable
meal even to strangers visiting the meeting. Besides
myself, there were at least two others present who were
not members,—two German Catholic women, such as
hire out to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>The silent pause before and after eating was also observed
by the second table; and after we rose a third
company sat down.</p>

<p>When all had done, I gave a little assistance in clearing
the tables, in carrying the butter into the cellar and
the other food to the wash-house. The dishes were
taken to the roofed porch between the latter and the
house, where some of the women-folk washed them. A
neat table stood at the foot of the cellar-stairs, and received
the valued product of the dairy, the fragments
being put away in an orderly manner.</p>

<p>I now had a time of leisure, for my driver had gone
to see a friend, and I must await his coming. This
gave me an opportunity to talk with several sisters. I
inquired of a fine-looking woman when the feet-washing
would be held, and when they took the Lord’s Supper.
When I asked whether they liked those who were not
members to attend the feet-washing, I understood her
to say that they did not.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (I attended, not a great while
after, a great Whitsuntide feet-washing and bread-baking
in the meeting-house of the New Mennonites.)</p>

<p>I had now an opportunity to examine the books.
Standing upon a bench, I took down a great volume,
well printed in the German language, and entitled “The
Bloody Theatre; or, The Martyr’s Mirror of the Baptists,
or Defenceless Christians, who, on Account of the
Testimony of Jesus, their Saviour, Suffered and were
Put to Death, from the Time of Christ to the Year
1660. Lancaster, 1814.” This book was a version
from the Dutch (<i>Holländisch</i>) of Thielem J. van Bracht,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and it has also been rendered from German into English.
I was not aware, at the time, that I had before me one
of the principal sources whence the history of the Mennonites
is to be drawn,—a history which is still unwritten.</p>

<p>The books were few in number, and I noticed no
other so remarkable as this. Another German one,
more modern in appearance, was entitled “Universal
Cattle-Doctor Book; or, The Cures of the old Shepherd
Thomas, of Bunzen, in Silesia, for Horses, Cattle, Sheep,
Swine, and Goats.”</p>

<p>While I was looking over the volumes, a little circumstance
occurred, which, although not flattering to
myself, is perhaps too characteristic to be omitted. My
“Dutch” neighbors are not great readers, and to read
German is considered an accomplishment even among
those who speak the dialect. To speak “Dutch” is
very common, of course, but to read German is a considerable
attainment. I have, therefore, sometimes surprised
a neighbor by being able to read the language.
I am naturally not unwilling to be admired, and, as
two or three sisters were standing near while I examined
the books, I endeavored in haste to give them a specimen
of my attainments. I therefore took a passage quickly
from the great “Martyr-Book,” and read aloud a sentence
like this: “Grace, peace, and joy through God
our Heavenly Father; wisdom, righteousness, and truth,
through Jesus Christ his Son, together with the illumining
of the Holy Spirit, be with you.” Glancing up to
see the surprise which my proficiency must produce, I
beheld a different expression of countenance, for the
attention of some of the thoughtful sisters was attracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
by the subject-matter, instead of the reader, and that
aroused a sentiment of devotion beautifully expressed.</p>

<p>I asked our host, “Have you no history of your
society?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered; “we just hand it down.”</p>

<p>I have since heard, however, that there are papers or
written records in charge of a person who lives at some
distance from me. From certain printed records I have
been able to trace a streamlet of history from its source
in Switzerland, where the Anabaptists suffered persecution
in Berne, Zurich, etc. I have read of their exile
into Alsace and the Palatinate; of the aid afforded to
them by their fellow-believers, the Mennonites of Holland;
and of their final colonization in Pennsylvania,
where they also are called Mennonites. The Amish,
however, seem to have been a body of a more rigid
rule, with a preacher named Amen, from whom they
are called. It has been stated that they took their rise
in Alsace in 1693.</p>

<p>Nearly all the congregation had departed when my
driver at last arrived. I shook hands with those that
were left, and kissed the pleasant mother of our host.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SWISS_EXILES">SWISS EXILES.</h2>

</div>

<p>The plain people among whom I live, Quaker-like
in appearance, and, like the Quakers, opposed to oaths
and to war, are to a great extent descendants of Swiss
Baptists or Anabaptists, who were banished from their
country for refusing to conform to the established Reformed
Church.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Some of the early exiles took refuge in Alsace and
the Palatinate, and afterwards came to Pennsylvania,
settling in Lancaster County, under the kind patronage
of our distinguished first proprietor. William Penn’s
sympathy for them was doubtless increased by their
resembling himself in so many important particulars.
Mennonites from Holland were also among the early
settlers at Germantown.</p>

<p>If any one inclines to investigate the traditions of
these people, let him ask the plain old men of the county
whence they originated. I think that a great part of
the Amish and other Mennonites will tell him of their
Swiss origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Nor are very important written records wanting upon
the subject of the Swiss persecutions. Two volumes in
use among our German Baptists narrate the story. The
first is the great Martyr-book, called “The Bloody
Theatre; or, Martyr’s Mirror of the Defenceless Christians,”
by Thielem J. van Bracht, published in Dutch,
about the year 1660; translated into German, and afterwards
into English.</p>

<p>The second printed record, circulating in our county,
and describing the sufferings of some of the Swiss Anabaptists,
is a hymn-book formerly in use among our
Old Mennists, but now, I think, employed only by the
Amish. It is a collection of “several beautiful Christian
songs,” composed in prison at Bassau, in the castle,
by the Switzer Brethren, “and by other orthodox (<i>rechtglaubige</i>)
Christians, here and there.”</p>

<p>The first of these works, the Martyr-book, was translated
into English by Daniel Rupp, the historian. I
have seen no English version of the hymn-book. I
met both these volumes in the Rhenish Palatinate in
1881. Bassau, mentioned in the hymn-book as the
place where the brethren were imprisoned, I have supposed
to be Passau, upon the Danube, in Bavaria. Is
it not so written in the Martyr-book?</p>

<p>Near the close of the hymn-book is an account of the
afflictions which were endured by the brethren in Switzerland,
in the canton of Zurich, on account of the gospel
(“<i>um des Evangeliums willen</i>”).</p>

<p>The first-mentioned work, the great Martyr-book, is a
ponderous volume.</p>

<p>The author begins his martyrology with Jesus, John,
and Stephen, whom he includes among the Baptist or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the defenceless martyrs. I suppose that he includes
them among the Baptists on the ground that they were
not baptized in infancy, but upon faith. From these
the great story comes down in one thousand octavo
pages, describing the intense cruelties of the Roman
emperors, telling of persecutions by the Saracens, persecutions
of the Waldenses and Albigenses, and describing
especially the sufferings which the Baptists (in
common with other Protestants) endured in Holland
under the reigns of Charles V. and Philip II.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The narrative of the persecution of the Anabaptists
of Switzerland by their fellow-Protestants is mostly
found at the close of the volume. It comes down to
the year 1672, and must therefore be, in part at least,
an appendix to the original volume.</p>

<p>Allusions to the severe treatment of the Anabaptists
of Switzerland may also be found in Herzog’s and
Appleton’s Cyclopædias.</p>

<p>In the former work we read that Anabaptism, after
a public theological disputation, was by the help of the
authorities suppressed in Switzerland. And how thoroughly
it was suppressed may be inferred from the
statement in the latter of the population of Berne. In
1850 the population is given (in round numbers) as
458,000,—of which only 1000 are Baptists, 54,000
are Catholics, and the remainder of the Reformed
Church.</p>

<p>In Appleton’s Cyclopædia (article Anabaptists), we
read that Melanchthon and Zwingle were themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
troubled by questions respecting infant baptism, in
connection with the personal faith required by Protestantism.
Nevertheless, Zwingle himself is said to
have pronounced sentence upon Mentz, who had been
his friend and fellow-student, in these words: “Whosoever
dips (or baptizes) a second time, let him be dipped.”
“<i>Qui iterum mergit, mergatur.</i>” This humorous saying
seems to be explained in the Martyr-book, for we read
that Felix Mentz was drowned at Zurich for the truth
of the gospel in 1526. The persecution of such men is
said to have shocked the moderate of all parties.</p>

<p>Upon the authority of Balthazar Hubmor (whom I
suppose to be the Hubmeyer of the Cyclopædia), the
Martyr-book states that Zwingle, etc., imprisoned at one
time twenty persons of both sexes, in a dark tower, never
more to see the light of the sun. This early Swiss Protestant
persecution occurred, it will be observed, about
1526, and the latest recorded in the Martyr-book in or
about 1672, covering a period of nearly one hundred
and fifty years.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At the same time that the Swiss Baptists were suffering
at the hands of other Protestants, Anabaptists of
the peaceful class were found in Holland in large numbers.
The record of their sufferings and martyrs (says
Appleton’s Cyclopædia) furnished a touching picture in
human history. William of Orange, founder of the
Dutch republic, was sustained in the gloomiest hours by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
their sympathy and aid.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> That great prince, however
importuned, steadily refused to persecute them.</p>

<p>Menno Symons, born at the close of the fifteenth or
the commencement of the sixteenth century, educated
for the priesthood of the Roman Catholic church, converted
in manhood to the faith of the Anabaptists, became
their chief leader. Mennonites and Anabaptists
have from his time been interchangeable terms.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>It was about seventeen years after the drowning of
Mentz in Switzerland, and while the Catholic persecution
was raging in Holland, that in the year 1543 an
imperial edict was issued against Menno; for both parties
persecuted the Baptists,—the Catholics in the Low
Countries, the Protestants in Switzerland. The Martyr-book
tells us that a dreadful decree was proclaimed
through all West Friesland, containing an offer of general
pardon, the favor of the emperor, and a hundred
carlgulden to all malefactors and murderers who would
deliver Menno into the hands of the executioners. Under
pain of death, it was forbidden to harbor him; but God
preserved and protected him wonderfully, and he died a
natural death, near Lubeck, in the open field, in 1559,
aged sixty-six. It is further mentioned that he was
buried in his own garden.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>About fourteen years after the death of Menno, or in
the year 1573, we read in the Martyr-book that Dordrecht
had submitted to the reigning prince, William of
Orange, the first not to shed blood on account of faith
or belief.</p>

<p>But the toleration which William extended to the
Baptists was not imitated by his great compeer, Elizabeth
of England. For the Martyr-book tells us that in
1575 “some friends,” who had fled to England, having
met in the suburbs of London “to hear the word of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
God,” were spied out, and the constable took them to
prison. Two of these were burnt at Smithfield, in the
eighteenth year of Elizabeth. Jan Pieters was one of
them, a poor man whose first wife had been burnt at
Ghent; he then married a second, whose first husband
had been burnt at the same place.</p>

<p>Thus it befell the unfortunate Jan that while his wife
was burnt by Catholics, he himself suffered at the hands
of English Protestants.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>The expression “sheep” or “lambs,” which is applied
to some of the Baptist martyrs, alludes, I suppose, to
their non-resistance. Thus, in 1576, Hans Bret, a servant,
whose master was about to be apprehended, gave
him warning, so that he escaped, but himself, “this innocent
follower of Christ, fell into the paws of the
wolves.... As he stood at the stake, they kindled the
fire, and burnt this sheep alive.”</p>

<p>The next year after this, William of Orange had occasion
to call to order, as it appears, some of his own
subjects. The magistrates of Middelburg had announced
to the Baptists that they must take an oath of fidelity
and arm themselves, or give up their business and shut
up their houses. The Baptists had recourse to William,
promising to pay levies and taxes, and desiring to be
believed on their yea and nay. William granted their
request, their yea was to be taken in the place of an
oath, and the delinquent was to be punished as for
perjury.</p>

<p>In William Penn’s Treatise on Oaths it is stated
that William of Orange said, “Those men’s yea must
pass for an oath, and we must not urge this thing
any further, or we must confess that the Papists had
reason to force us to a religion that was against our
conscience.”</p>

<p>About nine years after William had thus reproved
the magistrates of Middelburg, or in the year 1586, the
Baptists came to grief elsewhere. It is stated that those
called Anabaptists, who had taken refuge in the Prussian
dominions, were ordered by “the prince of the
country” to depart from his entire duchy of Prussia,
and in the next year from all his dominions. This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
because they were said to speak scandalously of infant
baptism.</p>

<p>About the close of the century, pleasanter times for
the Baptists seem to have followed. “When the north
wind of persecution became violent, there were intervals
when the pleasant south wind of liberty and repose
succeeded.”</p>

<p>“But now occurred the greatest mischief in Zurich
and Berne, by those who styled themselves Reformed;”
but others of the same name, “especially the excellent
regents of the United Netherlands,” opposed such proceedings.</p>

<p>The Martyr-book says, in substance, “It is a lamentable
case that those who boast that they are the followers
of the defenceless Lamb do no longer possess the lamb’s
disposition, but, on the contrary, have the nature of the
wolf. It seems as if they could not bear it that any
should travel towards heaven in any other way than that
which they go themselves, as was exemplified in the case
of Hans Landis, who was a minister and teacher of the
gospel of Christ. Being taken to Zurich, he refused to
desist from preaching and to deny his faith, and was
sentenced to death,—the edict of eighty years before not
having died of old age. They, however, persuaded the
common people that he was not put to death for religion’s
sake, but for disobedience to the authorities.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>After the death of Hans Landis, persecution rested
for twenty-one years, when the ancient hatred broke out
afresh in Zurich.</p>

<p>The Baptists now asked permission to leave the country
with their property, but this was not granted to
them. “They might choose,” says the Martyrology,
“to go with them [the Reformed] to church, or to die
in prison. To the first they would not consent; therefore
they might expect the second.”</p>

<p>This brings us to the era of the persecution described
in the hymn-book of which I formerly spoke,—the book
now in use among the Amish of our county.</p>

<p>This little volume—little when compared to the ponderous
Martyr-book—gives an account of the persecution
in Zurich between the years 1635 and 1645. Many of
the persons mentioned in the hymn-book as suffering at
that time appear to be of families now found in Lancaster
County,—not merely from the hymn-book’s being
preserved here, but especially because some of the surnames
are the same as are now found here, or only
slightly different. Thus we have Landis, Meylin,
Strickler, Bachmann; and Gut, now Good; Müller, now
Miller; Baumann, now Bowman.</p>

<p>Mention is made of about eighteen persons who died
in prison during this persecution, in the period of nine
or ten years. Proclamation was made from the pulpits
forbidding the people to afford shelter to the Baptists:
even their own children who harbored them were liable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
to be fined,—as Hans Müller’s wife and children, who
were fined forty pounds because “they showed mercy
to their dear father.”</p>

<p>The hymn-book states that the <i>Gelehrte</i> (the learned
or the clergy?) accompanied the captors, running day
and night with their servants. Many of the persecuted
fell into the power of the authorities,—men and women,
the pregnant, the nursing mother, the sick.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, the authorities of Amsterdam,
themselves Calvinists or Reformed, being moved by the
solicitations of the Baptists of Amsterdam, sent a respectful
petition to the burgomaster and council of
Zurich to mitigate the persecution; but the petition, it
is said, excited an unfriendly and irritating answer.</p>

<p>It seems that some of the Baptists, harassed in Zurich,
took refuge in Berne; and about the time that the persecution
in Zurich came to a close, or about 1645, it is
stated that “those of Berne” threatened the Baptists.
About four years after, “those of Schaffhausen” issued
an edict against the people called Anabaptists.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Only a few years later, or in 1653, as we read in the
Martyr-book, there was another persecution elsewhere.
The record says, in substance, “As a lamb in making its
escape from the wolf is eventually seized by the bear,
so it obtained for several defenceless followers of the
meek Jesus, who, persecuted in Switzerland by the
Zwinglians, were permitted to live awhile in peace in
the Alpine districts, under a Roman Catholic prince,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Willem Wolfgang. About this year, however, this
prince banished the Anabaptists, so called. But they
were received in peace and with joy elsewhere, particularly
in Cleves, under the Elector of Brandenburg, and
in the Netherlands. ‘When they persecute you in one
city,’ saith the Lord, ‘flee ye into another.’”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>About six years after, or in 1659, an edict was issued
in Berne, from which extracts are given in the Martyr-book.
If the edict in full brings no more serious charges
against the Baptists than do these extracts, this paper
itself may be regarded as a noble vindication of the
Anabaptists of Switzerland at this era.</p>

<p>According to the substance of this Bernese edict the
teachers of this people—<i>i.e.</i>, the preachers—were to be
seized wherever they could be sought out, “and brought
to our orphan asylum to receive the treatment necessary
to their conversion; or, if they persist in their obstinacy,
they are to receive the punishment in such cases belonging.
Meantime the officers are to seize their property,
and present an inventory of the same.</p>

<p>“To the Baptists in general, who refuse to desist from
their error, the punishment of exile shall be announced.
It is our will and command that they be escorted to the
borders, a solemn promise obtained from them, since
they will not swear, and that they be banished entirely
from our country till it be proved that they have been
converted. Returning unconverted, and refusing to recant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
they shall be whipped, branded, and again banished,
which condign punishment is founded upon the following
reasons and motives:</p>

<p>“1. All subjects should confirm with an oath the allegiance
which they owe to the authorities ordained them
of God. The Anabaptists, who refuse the oath, cannot
be tolerated.</p>

<p>“2. Subjects should acknowledge that the magistracy
is from God, and with God. But the Anabaptists, who
declare that the magisterial office cannot exist in the
Christian church, are not to be tolerated in the country.</p>

<p>“3. All subjects are bound to protect and defend their
country. But the Anabaptists refuse to bear arms, and
cannot be tolerated....</p>

<p>“5. The magistracy is ordained of God to punish
evil-doers, especially murderers, etc. But the Anabaptists
refuse to report these to the authorities, and therefore
they cannot be tolerated.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“6. Those who refuse to submit to the wholesome
ordinances of the government, and who act in opposition
to it, cannot be tolerated. Now the Anabaptists transgress
in the following manner:</p>

<p>“They preach without the calling of the magistracy;
baptize without the command of the authorities; ...
and do not attend the meetings of the church.</p>

<p>“We have unanimously resolved that all should inflict
banishment and the other penalties against all who
belong to this corrupted and extremely dangerous and
wicked sect, that they may make no further progress,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
but that the country may be freed from them; on which,
in grace, we rely.</p>

<p>“As regards the estate of the disobedient exiles, or of
those who have run away, it shall, after deducting costs,
be divided among the wives and children who remain in
obedience.</p>

<p>“We command that no person shall lodge nor give
dwelling to a Baptist, whether related to him or not, nor
afford him the necessaries of life. But every one of our
persuasion should be exhorted to report whatever information
he can obtain of them to the high bailiff.</p>

<p>“And an especial proclamation of this last article shall
be made from the pulpit.”</p>

<p>This Bernese edict, being read in all parts, was a
source of great distress, and it appeared to the Baptists
as if “the beautiful flower of the orthodox Christian
church” would be entirely extirpated in those parts.</p>

<p>It was therefore concluded to send certain persons
from the cities of Dordrecht, Leyden, Amsterdam, etc.,
to the Hague, where the puissant States-General were in
session, to induce them to send petitions to Berne and
Zurich for the relief of the people suffering oppression.</p>

<p>The States-General, as “kind fathers of the poor, the
miserable, and the oppressed,” took immediate cognizance
of the matter.</p>

<p>Letters were written “to the lords of Berne” for the
liberation of prisoners, etc., and to the lords of Zurich
for the restoration of the property of the imprisoned,
deceased, and exiled Baptists. The letter to Berne narrates
(in brief) that “the States-General have learned,
from persons called in this country Mennonists, that
their brethren called Anabaptists suffer great persecution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
at Berne, being forbidden to live in the country,
but not allowed to remove with their families and property.
We have likewise learned that some of them
have been closely confined; which has moved us to
Christian compassion.</p>

<p>“We request you, after the good example of the
lords-regent of Schaffhausen, to grant the petitioners
time to depart with their families and property wherever
they choose. To this end we request you to consider
that when, in 1655, the Waldenses were so virulently
persecuted by the Romans for the confession of their
Reformed religion, and the necessities of the dispersed
people could not be relieved but by large collections
raised in England, this country, etc., the churches of
the Baptists, upon the simple recommendation of their
governments, and in Christian love and compassion,
contributed with so much benevolence that a remarkably
large sum was raised.... Farewell, etc. At the Hague,
1660.”</p>

<p>The letter of the States-General to Zurich is similar
to the foregoing abstract.</p>

<p>Besides these acts of the States-General, several cities
of the United Netherlands, being entirely opposed to
restraint of conscience, reproved “the members of their
society in Switzerland,” and exhorted them to gentleness.</p>

<p>Thus, the burgomasters and lords of Rotterdam, speaking
in behalf of the elders of the church called Mennonist,
whose fellow-believers in Berne are called in
derision Anabaptists: “As to ourselves, honorable lords,
we are of opinion that these men can be safely tolerated
in the commonwealth, and for this judgment we have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
thank William, Prince of Orange, of blessed memory,
who established, by his bravery, liberty of conscience for
us, and could never be induced to deprive the Mennonites
of citizenship.</p>

<p>“We have never repented of this, for we have never
learned that these people have sought to excite sedition,
but, on the contrary, they have cheerfully paid their
taxes.</p>

<p>“Although they confess that Christians cannot conscientiously
act as officers of government, and are opposed
to swearing, yet they do not refuse obedience to
the authorities, and, if they are convicted of a violation
of truth, are willing to undergo the punishment due to
perjury. We indulge the hope that your lordships will
either repeal the onerous decree against the Mennonists
or at least grant to the poor wanderers sufficient time to
make their preparations, and procure residences in other
places.</p>

<p>“When this is done, your lordships will have accomplished
a measure well pleasing to God, advantageous to
the name of the Reformed, and gratifying to us who are
connected with your lordships in the close ties of religion.
Rotterdam, 1660.”</p>

<p>These appeals of the States-General and of the cities
of Holland seem to have had very little effect, at least
upon the authorities of Berne, for there arose eleven
years later, or in 1671, another severe persecution of the
Baptists in that canton, which was so virulent that it
seemed as if the authorities would not cease until they
had expelled that people entirely.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, seven hundred persons, old
and young, were constrained to forsake their property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
relations, and country, and retire to the Palatinate.
Some of them, it seems, took refuge in Alsace, above
Strasburg.</p>

<p>An extract from a letter given in the Martyr-book
says, “Some follow chopping wood, others labor in the
vineyards; hoping, I suppose, that after some time tranquillity
will be restored, and they will be able to return
to their habitations; but I am afraid that this will not
happen soon.... The authorities of Berne had six of
the prisoners (one of whom was a man that had nine
children) put in chains and sold as galley-slaves between
Milan and Malta.”</p>

<p>(We may infer that this, however, was not the first
infliction of this punishment at Berne. A list in the
Martyr-book of persons put to death for their faith concludes
thus: “Copied from the letter of Hans Loersch,
while in prison at Berne, 1667, whence he was taken in
chains to sea.”)</p>

<p>This severe penalty of being sold as slaves to row the
galleys or great sail-boats which traversed the Mediterranean
was also impending over other able-bodied prisoners,
as it is said, but “a lord of Berne,” named Beatus,
was excited to compassion, and obtained permission that
the prisoners should leave the country upon bail that
they would not return without permission.</p>

<p>In the year 1672 the brethren in the United Netherlands
(the Mennonites or Baptists) sent some of their
members into the Palatinate to inquire into the condition
of the refugees, and the latter were comforted and
supported by the assistance of the churches and members
of the United Netherlands.</p>

<p>There were among the refugees husbands and wives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
who had to abandon their consorts, who belonged to the
Reformed Church and could not think of removal.
Among these were two ministers, whose families did not
belong to the church (Baptist), and who had to leave
without finding whether their wives would go with
them, or whether they loved their property more than
their husbands. “Such incidents occasioned the greater
distress, since the authorities granted such persons remaining
permission to marry again.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Alsace and the Palatinate (lying upon the Rhine),
where our Swiss exiles had taken refuge, were soon after
devastated in the great wars of their ambitious neighbor,
Louis XIV., King of France. Turenne, the French
general, put the Palatinate, a fine and fertile country,
full of populous towns and villages, to fire and sword.
The Elector Palatine, from the top of his castle at Mannheim,
beheld two cities and twenty towns in flames. Turenne,
with the same indifference, destroyed the ovens,
and laid waste part of the country of Alsace, to prevent
the enemy from subsisting.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>About fourteen years after, or in the winter of 1688-89,
the Palatinate was again ravaged by the French
king’s army. The French generals gave notice to the
towns but lately repaired, and then so flourishing, to the
villages, etc., that their inhabitants must quit their
dwellings, although it was then the dead of winter; for
all was to be destroyed by fire and sword.</p>

<p>“The flames with which Turenne had destroyed two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
towns and twenty villages of the Palatinate were but
sparks in comparison to this last terrible destruction,
which all Europe looked upon with horror.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Between the time of these two great raids there occurred
several noteworthy incidents. There came to
Holland and Germany, in the year 1677, a man who
was then of little note, a man of peace, belonging to a
new and persecuted sect, but who has since become better
known in history, at least to us who inhabit Pennsylvania,
than Marshal Turenne, or the great Louis
XIV. himself. It was the colonizer and statesman, the
Quaker William Penn.</p>

<p>The Elector Palatine then reigning was a relative of
the King of England. Penn failed to see this prince,
but he addressed a letter to him, to the “Prince Elector
Palatine of Heydelbergh,” in which he desires to know
“what encouragement a colony of virtuous and industrious
families might hope to receive from thee, in case
they should transplant themselves into this country,
which certainly in itself is very excellent, respecting
taxes, oaths, arms, etc.”</p>

<p>I know not what encouragement, if any, the Elector<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
offered to Penn; but only about four years later Penn’s
great colony was founded across the Atlantic, a colony
which afforded refuge to many “Palatines.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Of this journey to Germany and Holland, just spoken
of, Penn kept a journal, and there is mention made at
Amsterdam of Baptists and “Menists,” or Mennonites;
but whether he ever met on the Continent any of our
Swiss exiles I do not find stated in history. Of his
other two journeys to Germany, no journal has been
found.</p>

<p>Eight years after Penn’s journey there occurred, in
the year 1685, a circumstance which may have especially
interested our Swiss Baptists and have operated to bring
their colony to Pennsylvania; for in June of that year
the Elector Palatine dying without issue, the electoral
dignity went to a Roman Catholic family.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The Swiss exiles that first took refuge in Lancaster
County came here about thirty-eight years after the
severe Bernese persecution of 1671. Rupp, the historian
of our county, tells us that in 1706 or 1707 a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
number of the persecuted Swiss Mennonites went to
England and made a particular agreement with the
honorable proprietor, William Penn, for lands. He
further says that several families from the Palatinate,
descendants of the distressed Swiss, emigrated to America
and settled in Lancaster County in the year 1709.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The sympathy of the Society of Friends, William
Penn’s co-religionists, was at this time called out for
this people in a substantial manner. Barclay says, “Not
only did the leaders of the early Society of Friends take
great interest in the Mennonites, but the Yearly Meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of 1709 contributed fifty pounds (a very large sum
at that time) for the Mennonites of the Palatinate who
had fled from the persecution of the Calvinists in Switzerland.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The next year the commissioners of property had
agreed with Martin Kendig, Hans Herr, etc., “Switzers”
lately arrived in this province, for ten thousand acres of
land twenty miles east of Connystogoe. (This Connystogoe
I cannot locate. The Conestoga Creek empties
into the Susquehanna below Lancaster.)</p>

<p>The supplies of the colonists were at first scanty, until
the seed sown in a fertile soil yielded some thirty-, others
forty-fold.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Their nearest mill was at Wilmington, distant,
as I estimate, some thirty miles.</p>

<p>One of their number was soon sent to Europe to bring
out other emigrants, and after the accession the colony
numbered about thirty families. They mingled with
the Indians in hunting and fishing. These were hospitable
and respectful to the whites.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>We are told that the early colonists had strong faith
in the fruitfulness and natural advantages of their choice
of lands. “They knew these would prove to them and
their children the home of plenty.” Their anticipations
have never failed.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>The harmony existing between the Indians and these
men of peace is very pleasing. Soon after their first
settlement here, Lieutenant-Governor Gookin made a
journey to Conestogo (1711), and in a speech to the
Indians tells them that Governor Penn intends to present
five belts of wampum to the Five Nations, “and
one to you of Conestogo, and requires your friendship
to the Palatines, settled near Pequea.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> About seven
years after this, William Penn died in England, in the
year 1718.</p>

<p class="tb">Dr. Seidensticker compares the German emigration
hither, in its origin, to the Quaker and Puritan. After
the Lutherans and Reformed had succeeded in gaining
a recognition, there were sects in Germany who did
not agree with the three recognized confessions and
who were bitterly persecuted. Against such Christians
the indignation of the clergy and the wrath of the
civil authorities was directed in almost every German
land.</p>

<p>Says Herzog’s Cyclopædia:</p>

<p>“When the Baptists were oppressed in Switzerland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and the Palatinate, the Mennonites united into one community
with the Palatines at Groningen (Holland), and
established in 1726 a fund for the needy abroad, to which
Baptists of all parties richly contributed. About eighty
years after this fund was discontinued, being no longer
thought necessary.”</p>

<p>Thus active persecution of the Baptists in those regions
had ceased, it seems, about the year 1800.</p>

<p>The German or Swiss colony in Lancaster County is
said to have caused some alarm, though we can hardly
believe it a real fear. Nine years after the death of
William Penn, representation was made to Lieutenant-Governor
Gordon (1727) that “a large number of Germans,
peculiar in their dress, religion, and notions of
political government, had settled on Pequea, and were
determined not to obey the lawful authority of government;
that they had resolved to speak their own language,
and to acknowledge no sovereign but the great
Creator of the universe.”</p>

<p>Rupp, from whom I quote the above passage, adds:
“There was perhaps never a people who felt less disposed
to disobey the lawful authority of government
than the Mennonites against whom these charges were
made.”</p>

<p>The charges were doubtless dropped, or answered
in a satisfactory manner; for two years subsequently,
or in 1729, a naturalization act was passed concerning
certain Germans who had emigrated into the
province between the years 1700 and 1718. Over one
hundred persons are naturalized by this act (Martin
Meylin, Hans Graaf, etc.); and a great part of the
people of the county can find their surnames mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
therein.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> All the names, however, are not necessarily
those of Baptist families.</p>

<p>Nearly to the same date as this naturalization act
belongs a letter written from Philadelphia, in 1730, by
the Rev. Jedediah Andrews.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews says, in substance, “There are in this
province a vast number of Palatines; those that have
come of late years are mostly Reformed. The first-comers,
though called Palatines, are mostly Switzers,
many of whom are wealthy, having got the best land in
the province. They live sixty or seventy miles off, but
come frequently to town with their wagons laden with
skins belonging to the Indian traders, with butter, flour,
etc.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Andrews, in his letter, while speaking of the
Switzers, continues: “There are many Lutherans and
some Reformed mixed among them.... Though there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
be so many sorts of religion going on, we don’t quarrel
about it. We not only live peaceably, but seem to love
one another.”</p>

<p>This harmony among the multitudinous sects in Pennsylvania
must have been the more remarkable to Mr.
Andrews from his having been born and educated in
Massachusetts, where a very different state of affairs had
prevailed; and on this subject Rupp says, “The descendants
of the Puritans boast that their ancestors fled
from persecution, willing to encounter perils in the wilderness,
and perils by the heathen, rather than be
deprived of the free exercise of their religion. The
descendants of the Swiss Mennonites in Lancaster County
claim that while their ancestors sought for the same liberty,
they did not persecute others who differed from
them in religious opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The letter of Mr. Andrews, above quoted, bears date
1730. Twelve years after, or in 1742, a respectable
number of the Amish (pronounced Ommish) of Lancaster
County petitioned the General Assembly that a
special law of naturalization might be passed for their
benefit. They stated that they had emigrated from
Europe by an invitation from the proprietaries; that
they had been brought up in and were attached to the
Amish doctrine, and were conscientiously scrupulous
against taking oaths; “they therefore cannot be naturalized
agreeably to the existing law.” An act was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
passed in conformity to their request. (I give this statement
as I find it, although somewhat surprised if the
laws of Pennsylvania did not always allow those to affirm
who were conscientiously opposed to oaths.)</p>

<p>The history of our Swiss Exiles is nearly finished. It
is chiefly when a nation is in adversity that its history is
interesting to us. What is there to tell of a well-to-do
farming population, who do not participate in battles,
and who live almost entirely secluded from public
affairs?<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Under the date 1754 it is noted that Governor Pownall,
travelling in Lancaster County, says, “I saw the
finest farm one can possibly conceive, in the highest
culture; it belongs to a Switzer.” Thus Gray’s lines
(slightly altered) may be said to comprise most of the
external history of this people for a century and a
half:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some difficulty had arisen, however, between the Germans
of our county and the “Scotch-Irish.” Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Day, in his Historical Collections, says, “The Presbyterians
from the north of Ireland came in at about the
same time with the Germans, and occupied the townships
of Donegal and Paxton.” (Paxton, now Dauphin
County.) “Collisions afterwards occurring between them
and the Germans concerning elections, bearing of arms,
the treatment of the Indians, etc., the proprietaries instructed
their agents in 1755 that the Germans should
be encouraged, and in a manner directed to settle along
the southern boundary of the province, in Lancaster and
York Counties, while the Irish were to be located nearer
to the Kittatinny Mountain, in the region now forming
Dauphin and Cumberland Counties.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In the Revolutionary war, the German Mennonites
did not early espouse the cause of independence. Some
of them doubtless felt bound by their promise of loyalty
to the established government, while others were perhaps
influenced by the motive lately attributed to them in the
correspondence of one of our county papers (<i>Examiner
and Herald</i>, Lancaster, October 27, 1869). The writer
tells us that Lancaster County was settled principally
by Mennonites, etc., who are strict non-resistants. They
were peculiarly solicitous to manifest their loyalty to the
powers that be, because they had been accused by their
enemies of having been implicated in rebellion during
the unhappy events at Münster, Germany, in 1535.
“When our Revolutionary struggle began, these people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
were cautious in resisting the established government.”</p>

<p>During the late rebellion, although very few of our
Mennonites bore arms, yet some were active in raising
funds to pay bounties to persons who did enlist.</p>

<p class="tb">It appears to the writer that there can scarcely be a
people in our country among whom the ancient practices
are more faithfully maintained than among the Amish
of Lancaster County.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great falling off from ancient
principles and practices which we read of among Holland
Mennonites (see Herzog’s Cyclopædia and the Encyclopædia
Americana), it seems that there are yet left
in Europe others of the stricter rule. In Friesland,
Holland, where the Mennonites are divided, as here,
into three classes, there are found, by comparison, most
traces of the old Mennonism.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>And we have lately heard of Amish in France. A
letter from that country, published in the <i>Herald of
Truth</i> (Elkhart, Indiana, July, 1871), alludes to the
late European war. The writer says, “The loss we
here sustained is indescribable. Many houses have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
entirely shattered to pieces by the cannon-balls, and
others totally destroyed by fire.” He adds, “As you
desire to know what kind of Mennonites there are residing
here in France, I will briefly state that most of
them are Amish Mennonites.” He signs himself Isaac
Rich, Etupes, par Audincourt, Doubs, France.</p>

<p>This department, Doubs, adjoins Switzerland.</p>

<p>The church history of our Mennonites has not been
entirely uneventful. Rupp tells us that they were very
numerous about the year 1792, and that Martin Boehm
and others made inroads upon them. A considerable
number seceded and joined the United Brethren, or <i>Vereinigte
Brüder</i>.</p>

<p>A society of Dunkers was formed near the Susquehanna,
many years ago, by Jacob Engle, who had been
a Mennonite. This society is called “The River Brethren,”
and from it has been formed the society of “Brinser
Brethren,” popularly so called.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Herr is generally considered the
founder of a sect popularly called “New Mennists.”
They call themselves, however, “Reformed Mennonites,”
and claim that they have only returned to the
ancient purity of doctrine.</p>

<p>In Montgomery County, in 1873, I find the term
New Mennonites applied to another sect, while those of
whom I have just spoken are called “<i>Herrelite</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or
followers of Herr. The former are followers or friends
of a preacher named Overholtzer,—a man who refused
to put on a coat of a peculiar cut when he became a
preacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>In, or near, the same part of our State certain Mennonites
have left the society, desiring to “defend their
country,” and to join oath-bound societies. They call
themselves Trinity Christians.</p>

<p>How far the “Albrechtsleut,” or “Dutch Methodists,”—the
Evangelical Association, as they call themselves,—have
made converts among the Mennonites, I
cannot tell.</p>

<p>Mr. Rupp, whose history of Lancaster County is as
yet the standard, speaks of the Mennonites as the prevailing
religious denomination in 1843, having about
forty-five ministers preaching in German, and over thirty-five
meeting-houses.</p>

<p>The Amish meet in private houses. (In this year
1882, when preparing my third edition, I hear, however,
of their having so far broken through their old custom
as to have built at least one meeting-house in this State.)</p>

<p>Although I have never heard that our Mennonites as
a religious body passed any rules forbidding slaveholding,
as did the Quakers, yet they are in sentiment
strongly anti-slavery, having great faith in those who
are willing to labor with their own hands. Of this
strong anti-slavery sentiment I offer convincing proof
in the votes by which they supported in Congress our
late highly distinguished representative, Thaddeus Stevens.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>Columbian Magazine</i> for January, 1789, appears
an “Account of the Manners of the German Inhabitants
of Pennsylvania.” The writer, Dr. Rush,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
would properly have included Friends in the following
passage:</p>

<p>“Perhaps those German sects of Christians among us,
who refuse to bear arms for the purpose of shedding
human blood, may be preserved by Divine Providence,
as the centre of a circle which shall gradually embrace
all the nations of the earth in a perpetual treaty of
friendship and peace.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the first edition of this book was prepared, the
public attention has been much attracted to a great body
of Russian Mennonites who have come to this country,
rather than perform military duty in Russia; some of
these are of Swiss origin.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>One of my neighbors had before spoken to me in very
favorable terms of Russian Mennonites, but it did not
seem probable that such a body of people were to be
found in that empire, and I paid but little attention to
the subject.</p>

<p>The account which seems to me most valuable, among
newspaper items concerning them, was contained in a St.
Petersburg letter in the <i>New York Tribune</i> of May 11,
1872.</p>

<p>The writer tells us that about the time of Menno’s
death there was a large emigration of his flock to East
Prussia, where their Dutch neatness and industry soon
made those desolate and swampy regions to flourish like
a garden. In 1730 and 1732 they were threatened with
expatriation for refusing to serve in the army; but the
storm passed by, and other colonists came in. Arbitrary
measures, however, were still taken from time to time,
and in 1789 they were forbidden to purchase landed
property.</p>

<p>Catherine II. of Russia, while inviting German colonists,
also invited these, and before the year 1800 about
three hundred and fifty families of Mennonites had entered
Russia, and settled on the lower Dnieper. They
came on condition of receiving freedom of worship, “the
administration of oaths in their own way” (the writer
does not appear to understand their objection to swearing
at all), “and exemption forever from military service.”
They were also to receive one hundred and ninety acres
of land for each family, money for their journey, etc.</p>

<p>The privileges were confirmed by the Emperor Paul,
and extended to all coming after; and although the
laws of Prussia had been altered, there was a continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
migration of Mennonites to Russia until 1817. These
settled near their brethren, and not far from the town
of Berdiansk.</p>

<p>The Mennonites have prospered until they number
about forty thousand. They settled on a waste steppe,
where the land was rich enough, but suffered much from
want of water. They irrigated, and raised agriculture
to a higher point than anywhere else in Russia. They
had no wood, and they planted trees. The introduction
of tree culture on the steppes is entirely owing to them.
They have not only large orchards, but productive forest-trees,
and plantations of mulberry-trees, by means of
which they produce silk. They are also large raisers of
stock.</p>

<p>Although originally agriculturists, they have endeavored
to supply their own wants in manufactured articles,
and in 1854 they had in activity three hundred and fifty
mills and factories, including cloth-mills, water- and
grist-mills, dyeing and printing works, breweries, distilleries,
silk-spinneries, brick and tile works, potteries,
etc., and in their villages there were men exercising
nearly every known trade.</p>

<p>There is no drunkenness or gambling among them.
Crime is exceedingly rare. Besides all this, they are
educated. Every child knows how to read and write;
and in every village there is a school.</p>

<p>Up to this time they have been loyal subjects to Russia.
During the Crimean war they sent large gifts of
grain and provender to the besieged army. It is only
because the privileges granted to them are infringed, and
they will be compelled to enter the army against their
conscience, that they now wish to emigrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Their success in tree culture on an arid steppe points
naturally to the Western prairies as their future home.
In their petitions to the American and British governments
they asked whether they could obtain land free,
or at low prices, for their whole colony; whether they
could have exemption for themselves and their descendants
from military service of every kind; and whether
the government would advance them any money to defray
their travelling expenses. Though the colony is
prosperous, and some of the members rich, yet there are
some who either have no land, or have so little property
that a forced sale would leave them almost destitute.</p>

<p>In addition to the above from the <i>New York Tribune</i>,
I have found an extract concerning the Mennonites of
South Russia, from <i>The Friend</i> (London), in which it is
stated that a deputation was sent to St. Petersburg in
hopes of changing the purpose of the government, but
only obtained a delay of ten years, which expired in
1881, and also the option of hospital and other non-fighting
military service in place of actual soldiership.
Many deputations have since followed. The last attempt
was by a company of “eldest persons” to the emperor,
while he was staying at his country palace in the
Crimea. We learn “the emperor did not accept an
audience, but kind words by others were spoken plenty.”
Extracts follow from an original letter, preserving the
quaint English: “We greatly see the need of leaving
Russia, not only because of military service, but also of
the curtailing of religious and other liberties, which
clearly shows an intention on the part of the government
to take this and our language from us. Formerly,
the administration of all laws connected with the colonies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
was in the hands of the colonists themselves; now
they are mixed up with the Russian peasants. The
Russ language, hitherto not, or little, wanted, is introduced
into the schools, and Russian teachers are given
to those schools. Prisons, like as in the Russian villages,
are by law commanded to build; before, not at all
wanted.”</p>

<p>But while the Russian Mennonites are thus preparing
to emigrate, it is stated that in Prussia there are only a
few churches that are not willing to submit to the new
military law.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Herald of Truth</i>, a Mennonite paper
(Elkhart, Indiana), speaks to the Russians nearly as follows:
“I believe I understand the sad dilemma in
which you are placed. You have homes, the result of
honest toil; you love and cherish them; there is a long
journey to make into a strange land; it will cost you a
great many anxieties and trials; all these things seem
almost impossible for you to accomplish, and yet you
cherish the principles of your church, you want to abide
in the faith of your fathers.</p>

<p>“In the country where you now are you are called to
do that which we believe Jesus, the Prince of Peace,
forbids. Now here is a dilemma. It will be for you to
choose. Shall we stay,—and yield the principles of our
religion? or shall we do as the Saviour said, ‘If they
persecute you in one city, flee into another’?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In 1881 I visited a few Mennonite communities in
Germany; the first being in the city of Crefeld, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Rhenish Prussia. I sought this town especially from
what I had learned of it in my own country. Crefeld
seems to have been a place of refuge in former times for
persecuted religionists. Here, in the seventeenth century,
Huguenot refugees introduced the manufacture of
silk, for which the town is still distinguished. Here
William Penn and others gained adherents to the Quaker
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And when the Dunkers were persecuted,
some of them took refuge in Crefeld, in the duchy of
Cleves.</p>

<p>Although Crefeld was so liberal, and although it now
belongs to Prussia, it is greatly Catholic. The population
is thus estimated: Catholics, 56,000; Evangelicals
or United Lutherans and Reformed, 18,000; Jews,
1500; Mennonites, 1000. But the attendance at the
Mennonite church which I visited did not indicate so
great a number. I cannot express more fully to our
own people of Lancaster County how much this church
differs from their own simple meetings at home than to
tell them that the preacher is paid, that he spoke from
a pulpit, wore a black robe, and read a prayer from a
book. Yet it is simple compared with the display of
Catholic churches.</p>

<p>But what my neighbors will probably consider as a
more vital difference between them and the Mennonites
of Crefeld is that the latter bear arms. Since 1868 they
have not been exempted from military service. They
can, however, if they desire, take peaceful positions, such
as nurses in military hospitals, or clerks; but while some
of their fellow-believers in Prussia avail themselves of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
this permission, those in Crefeld do not. One not a
Mennonite said to me that the positions in the army are
more honorable.</p>

<p>Why, then, do they not join the Evangelicals? Two
of the chief differences between them are that Mennonites
only baptize those of mature years and refuse
to swear in a court of justice, making instead nearly
the following declaration, “My yes is yes, my no is no,
and in testimony thereto I offer my right hand,”—the
<i>handschlag</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">The next Mennonite settlement which I visited was
that at Kuhbörnchenhof, not far from Kaiserslautern, in
the Rhenish Palatinate. Going among these people with
no letters of introduction, I was received with much
hospitality in the small rural settlement. Their ancestors
came from Switzerland in 1715. The first who
came to this place seems to have built himself a log
house; the country being nearly covered with wood,
with wild animals therein. Others joined him, until
the little settlement numbered eight families. Counting
all in the country round belonging to this church (or
congregation), it is said to number ninety-four baptized
persons. They baptize at the age of thirteen. Until
lately this settlement had an unpaid ministry; but a
few years ago they concluded to employ a minister.
However, he is not heavily paid. He preaches by
turns in three different settlements, and receives a salary
of about one hundred and eighty dollars (having a wife
and infant). There are larger communities, which pay
as much as two hundred and fifty to four hundred and
fifty dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The Rhenish Palatinate belongs to Bavaria. The
Mennonites here are no longer allowed to purchase exemption
from military service; all who are drawn must
serve.</p>

<p>One more effort I made in Germany to visit the Mennonites.
I heard in the city of Speyer that some were
living near Zweibrücken, and by perseverance I found
an Amish family not far from the town. It proved to
be that of a wealthy farmer, living in some respects more
plainly than our people here. This farmer, Mr. Stalter,
told me that all the Mennonites in the Palatinate came
from Switzerland. When they came many of them
were weavers, but now they have earned money, and all,
or almost all, are farmers. The manner in which the
sons of this family avoid protracted military service
seems to be by obtaining a higher degree of education.
I was told that since 1871 every young man in Germany
must perform military service at the age of twenty. If
he prefer, he may begin at sixteen. They usually go
into barracks for three years. But the three years’ service
can be shortened to one year, and otherwise lightened,
thus: First, the young man must be three years
in a common public school,—<i>Volks-schule</i>. Then he
must go six years to a school of higher grade, a <i>Real-schule</i>,
where he studies a foreign language (either French
or English), chemistry, physics, mathematics, history,
and natural history. (At the end of six years, if he
cannot pass his examination, he may go back and study
another year.) After this he is ready to enter upon the
mitigated military service for one year only. If he does
not wish to live in garrison, he can take a room elsewhere
and board himself, but go through all the military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
exercises with the other soldiers. In this case he must
furnish himself his uniform and other trappings. Of
this manner of escaping the three years’ service I think
that two sons of the Stalter family had already availed
themselves.</p>

<p>Close by Mr. Stalter lived another family named
Oesch. They had been Amish until 1871, and have
now joined the Tunkers (Dunkers), or those who immerse.
The Tunkers do not go to war. If they are
forced to do so, they go to America. They do go into
garrison, but they will not bear arms. They are then
taken before a military judge, and sometimes he sends
them to prison. When allowed to come out they can
work in barracks in bread-baking, the care of horses,
etc., but will not take arms, even possibly if they should
be threatened with death.</p>

<p>But they are not always sent to prison. When the
matter is understood by the authorities other labor than
military service is often assigned to them. It was in
this family of Oesch that I saw the two volumes which
I had before seen in Lancaster County. One was the
Martyr-book, which was published in Dutch, turned
into German by the brotherhood at Ephrata, and by
them printed in 1748;<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> printed anew by the united
brotherhood in Europe. The date, I think, was 1780.
The other volume was the old Hymn-Book, still in use
among the Amish in my own country. This copy was
published at Basle in 1809.</p>

<p>I have before spoken of the congregation that I visited
not far from Kaiserslautern, and of its preacher, who received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
a salary of about one hundred and eighty dollars.
I met the preacher there and at his own dwelling, and
he gave me a list, published in 1881, of the Mennonite
congregations in Germany, Galicia, Poland, and Russia.
Why those in Holland are not included I do not understand.
Others are omitted, for the preface says, “We
are sorry that we have not received any information
concerning the small congregations found in Switzerland,
as well as those in Alsace and Lorraine.” As far as my
own observation goes, the number of Mennonites in
Germany is not large. In Holland the number given
in Appleton’s Cyclopædia is over forty-four thousand in
the year 1869. Of those in Russia, the number mentioned
in the list which was presented to me (published
in 1881) is about forty thousand. But a private letter
from a Mennonite editor estimates that fifteen thousand
Russian Mennonites have come to this country, and that,
as there were about forty thousand in Russia in 1870,
only about twenty-five thousand are left there. The
editor mentions that they have settled here in Kansas,
Nebraska, Dakota, Minnesota, and Manitoba.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DUNKER_LOVE-FEAST">THE DUNKER LOVE-FEAST.</h2>

</div>

<p>On the morning of the 25th of September, 1871, I
took the cars of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad for
the borough of Mount Joy, in the northwest part of this
county of Lancaster. Finding no public conveyance
thence to the village of C., I obtained from my landlord
a horse and buggy and an obliging driver, who took me
four or five miles, for two dollars. We took a drive
round by the new Dunker meeting-house, which is a
neat frame building,—brown, picked out with white
window-frames. Behind it is a wood, upon which the
church-doors open, instead of upon the highway.</p>

<p>We heard here that the meeting would not begin till
one o’clock on the next day. Some of the brethren were
at the church, however, with their teams, having brought
provisions, straw, and bedding. We went into the neat
meeting-room, and above into the garret, where straw
was being laid down. A partition ran down the middle,
and upon the women’s side a small room had also
been divided from the rest, wherein were one or two
bedsteads and the inevitable cradle. The basement had
a hard earthen floor, and was divided into dining-room,
kitchen, and cellar. Upon spacious shelves in the cellar
a brother and sister were placing food. Many large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
loaves of bread were there. The sister was taking pies
from a great basket, and bright coffee-pots stood upon
the kitchen-table.</p>

<p>All here seemed to speak “Dutch,” but several talked
English with me. They seemed surprised that I had
come so far as twenty-three miles in order to attend the
meeting. One remarked that it was no member that
had put the notice of the meeting which I had seen into
the paper. Others, however, seemed interested, although
by my dress it was very plain that I was not of the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>I found C. a neat place of about a dozen houses, and
we drove to the only tavern. The landlady was young
and pleasant, but she could speak little English. She
was quite sociable, however, and thought that she could
teach me “Dutch” and I her English. By means of some
German on my part, we got along tolerably together.
She took me to a good chamber, and began removing
from it some of their best clothing. Showing me two
sun-bonnets, one of them made of black silk, she said,
“It is the fashion.” “The fashion?” said I. “Yes;
the fashion for married women.” This was, doubtless,
the Dunker influence even among those not members.</p>

<p>Being at leisure in the afternoon, I walked to an ancient
Moravian church in the neighborhood, with the
landlady’s little daughter,—a pretty child.</p>

<p>Her mother said, “Geh mit der aunty:” so she went
with her adopted relative.</p>

<p>“Do you speak English?” I said to the little one.</p>

<p>“Na!” she answered.</p>

<p>“Hast du ein Brüder?” (Have you a brother?) I
continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Na!” she replied, in the dialect.</p>

<p>“Wie alt bist du?” (How old are you?) I said afterward.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>“Vaze es net.” (I don’t know.)</p>

<p>Conversation flagged.</p>

<p>I found the church a small log building that had been
covered with boards. Many of the tombstones were in
the Moravian fashion, such as I had seen at Litiz,—small
square slabs, lying flat in the grass; and some
were numbered at the top of the inscription. One of
these is said to be one hundred and twenty years old.
But the Herrnhüter (as my landlady said) are all gone,
and another society now holds meetings in the lowly
church.</p>

<p>Although my little guide of six years could not speak
English, she was not wanting in good sense. As I was
trying to secure the graveyard gate, holding it with one
hand, and stooping to roll up the stone that served to
keep it fast, the little one, too, put out her hand, unbidden,
to hold the gate. I thought that there were
some English children that would not have been so
helpful, and reflected, as I walked along, upon <i>unspoken
language</i>, if I may use the expression.</p>

<p>The landlady had a plentiful supper after we returned.
I was the only guest, and, as is usual here,
the maid sat down with us. We had fried beef, sweet
potatoes, pie, very nice apple-butter, canned peaches,
barley-coffee, brown sugar, etc. The charge for board
was at the rate of one dollar per day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>In the evening I heard my hostess up-stairs preparing
my bed, as I supposed. My surprise was therefore considerable,
on turning down the woollen coverlet, to find
no sheets upon the feather bed. On lifting this light
and downy bed, which was neatly covered with white, I
found one sheet, a straw bed, and then a bed-cord in the
place of a sacking-bottom. I at once perceived that the
feather bed was a feather cover, of which I had often heard,
but had never met with one before during my sojourn
in Pennsylvania “Dutchland.” I should think that this
downy covering might be pleasant in cold weather, but
now I rolled it off upon the floor, and, with the help of
a spare comfortable, was soon at rest. The pillow-cases,
which were trimmed with edging, were marked with
black silk, in a large running-hand, in this manner:
“Henry G. Kreider, 1864.”</p>

<p>As I sat the next morning a while with the landlady
in her basement kitchen, she remarked, “Here is it as
Dutch as Dutchlant.” But she said that my Dutch
was not like theirs. The neighborhood, however, is not
nearly so German as Germany. I was told by an intelligent
young man that half the grown men did not
speak English; I understand by this, not that they do
not speak our language at all, but not habitually and
with fluency. Many speak English very well, but the
“Dutch” accent is universal. For several years the
school-books in the township have all been English.
I laughed with the landlady, who herself seemed somewhat
amused, at the children having English books and
speaking Dutch, or, as she would say, “Die Kinner
lerne Englisch und schwetze Deitsch.” However, at
the Dunker church a pretty girl told me afterward that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
she had had no difficulty at school the preceding winter,
although “we always talk German at home.”</p>

<p>At breakfast this morning, among other dishes, we
had raisin-pie. Not a great while after this meal was
over, the morning having proved wet, a neighbor took
me over to the church in his buggy for twenty-five
cents. Although the hour was so early, and meeting
was fixed to begin at one, I found a considerable number
here, which did not surprise me, as I knew the early
habits of our “Dutch” people. Taking a seat, I began
to read a number of the <i>Living Age</i>, when a black-eyed
maid before me, in Dunker dress, handed me her neatly-bound
hymn-book in English and German. I told her
that I could read German, and when I read a verse in
that language she said, “But you don’t know what it
means.” Reading German is with us a much rarer
accomplishment than speaking the dialect.</p>

<p>Ere long, a stranger came and sat down behind me,
and entered into conversation. He was a preacher from
a distance, named L., and spoke very good English.
We soon found that we had mutual acquaintances in
another county, and when dinner was ready he invited
me down to partake.</p>

<p>Here the men sat upon one side, and the women on
the other, of one of the long tables, upon which was
laid a strip of white muslin. We had bowls without
spoons, into which was poured by attending brethren
very hot coffee, containing milk or cream, but no sugar.
We had the fine Lancaster County bread, good and
abundant butter, apple-butter, pickles, and pies. The
provisions for these meals are contributed by the members
at a previous meeting, where each tells what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
intends to furnish, how many loaves of bread, etc.,
while some prefer to give money. To furnish provisions,
however, is natural to a people of whom about
seventy-five in a hundred are farmers, as is the case with
the Dunkers. Whatever food is left over after the four
meals are finished is given to the poor, without distinction
of sect; “whoever needs it most,” as a sister said.</p>

<p>At this dinner, before eating, my new acquaintance,
L., gave out, by two lines at a time, the verse,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Eternal are thy mercies, Lord.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But few joined in the singing. They would doubtless
have preferred German. In that language thanks were
returned after eating.</p>

<p>When we went up into the meeting-room again, a
young man of an interesting countenance, a preacher,
named Z., asked me if I was not the one who had written
an article which had lately appeared in one of our
county papers. It was very gratifying to be thus recognized
among strangers.</p>

<p>An elderly sister, who sat down by me and began to
talk, was named Murphy. The name surprised me
much, but it was not the only Irish one here. It is
probable that some such persons were taken into Dunker
families, when young, to be brought up, and thus had
been led to join the society.</p>

<p>Having observed that there was a good deal of labor
to be performed here in waiting upon so many people, I
asked Mrs. Murphy whether there were women hired.
She told me, “There’s a couple of women that’s hired;
but the members does a heap, too.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, I made a remark to a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
sister about the brethren’s waiting upon the table, as
they did. She answered that it was according to the
Testament to help each other; the women cooked, and
the men waited upon the table. She did not seem able
to give the text. It may be, “Bear ye one another’s
burdens.” I was amused that it should be so kindly
applied to the brethren’s helping the sisters.</p>

<p>Before meeting began in the afternoon, a lovely aged
brother, with silvery hair and beard, and wearing a
woollen coat nearly white, showed me how the seats were
made, so that, by turning down the backs of some, tables
could be formed for the Love-Feast. He told me that
the Dunkers number about one hundred thousand,—that
they have increased much in the West, but not in
the Eastern States. To which I rejoined, smiling, “You
Dutch folks do not like poor land, like much of that at
the East.”</p>

<p>“This is not good land,” he said, “we have improved
it;” for I had left the rich limestone soil and had come
to the gravelly land in the northern part of the county.</p>

<p>When meeting began, as brethren came in, I saw
some of these bearded men kissing each other. These
holy kisses, as will be seen hereafter, are frequent among
the Dunkers, and, as the men shave only the upper lip,
it seems strange to us who are unaccustomed to the sight
and the sound. The oft-repeated kissing was to me,
perhaps, the least agreeable part of the ceremonial.</p>

<p>The afternoon meeting became very crowded, and, as
is usual among our “Dutch” people, a number of babies
were in attendance. During the sessions their voices
sometimes rose high, but the noise did not seem to affect
those who were preaching or praying. They felt it perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
like the wailing and sighing of the wind, which
they regard not, and would rather bear the inconvenience
of the children than to have the mothers stay away
from meeting. This afternoon, during prayer, a little
fellow behind me kept saying, “Want to go to pappy;”
but if his father was among the brethren, he was on the
other side of the house.</p>

<p>My new acquaintance, L., was the only preacher here
who spoke in English. All the other exercises, except
a little singing, were in German or in our Pennsylvania
dialect. This afternoon L. said, among many remarks
more sectarian, or less broad, “Faith is swallowed up in
sight; hope, in possession; but charity, or love, is eternal.
It came from God, for God is love.” The allusion
here is to Paul’s celebrated panegyric on charity;
but how much more charming it is in the German version,
“Faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is
love. Love suffereth long and is kind, is not puffed
up,” etc.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon I perceived a
speaker giving some directions, and I asked the women
near me what he had said. One answered and said
something about “<i>Wahl halten für prediger</i>,” by which
I perceived that the election for a preacher was now to
take place. Both brethren and sisters were to vote; not
to select from a certain set of candidates, however; but
at random, among the congregation,—or <i>family</i>, as it is
sometimes called, “for all ye are brethren.”</p>

<p>In the room above-stairs were the bishop or elder and
an assistant, to receive the votes. This bishop we might
call the father of this family, which has four preachers
and as many meeting-houses. The bishop is always that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
preacher who is oldest in the ministry. Meeting is held
by turns in the different houses, occurring only once in
six weeks in the large new house which we then occupied.
These particulars, which I gathered in conversation,
are, I believe, substantially correct.</p>

<p>During the interval of the election I sat and read, or
looked out from my window at the young people, the
gayly-dressed girls mostly grouped together. Some of
these were, probably, relatives of the members, while
others may have come for the ride and the fun, to see
and to be seen,—meetings of this kind being great occasions
in the country-side.</p>

<p>The young men stood around on the outside of these
groups of girls, some holding their whips and twirling
them, with the butts resting upon the ground. Of course
the young girls were not conscious of the presence of the
beaux.</p>

<p>On the back of the house, or rather the front,—for,
as I have said, the main doors open upon the wood instead
of upon the roadside,—were more young girls, and
plain sisters and brethren.</p>

<p>I asked a nice-looking woman about the election, but
she could not tell me, although she wore the plain cap.
“Most of the women do around here,” she said, and
added that Dunker women in meeting had offered to
kiss her. “You know they greet each other with a kiss.”</p>

<p>After the brethren, the sisters were called up to vote.
I laughed, in talking with some of the members, at the
women’s being allowed to vote, in contrast to the usual
custom. Mrs. Murphy reckoned it would be different
if the women should undertake to vote for Governor or
President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>I said to some of the sisters, “Who do you think will
be chosen?” But they pleasantly informed me that to
talk upon this point was against their rules,—it was a
matter for internal reflection.</p>

<p>After meeting was over next day, as the bishop was
talking with a sister, I ventured to ask him whether a
majority was necessary to elect a preacher, or only a
plurality. He seemed quite willing to talk, displaying
no clerical pride, and answered, “A majority,” adding,
“Do you speak German?” I feared that I could not
readily understand him on such a subject, and put the
case to him thus in English: “Suppose one man has
twenty votes, another fifteen, and another ten?” Then
the bishop said that the one having twenty would be
elected; whence it seems that a plurality only is required.
On this occasion the vote was doubtless much divided,
for I afterward heard that the bishop had said to the
congregation that it seemed there were a good many there
that were thought fit for preachers.</p>

<p>As sunset approached, some of the members began to
form tables from the benches for the Love-Feast, which
made me wonder when supper was to be ready. I soon
found, however, that my ignorance of the language had
prevented my observing that while the “family” voted
the rest of the congregation were to sup. I was told,
however, that if I would go down I could still get something
to eat. These meals were free to every one that
came. All were received, in the hope that they would
obtain some spiritual good.</p>

<p>In the basement I found a number of men sitting at
the end of one of the tables, waiting for food, and I also
sat down near them. I was invited, however, by a sister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
to step into the kitchen, where I stood and partook of
hot coffee, bread and butter, etc. As we went along
through the dining-room, I thought that the sister cast
a reproachful glance at a disorderly man seated at the
table with his whip, and who was perhaps intoxicated.
I wondered that she should have taken me from the
table to stand in the kitchen, till I remembered that that
was <i>a men’s table</i>.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, brethren were busily occupied cutting
large loaves of bread into quarters for the coming Love-Feast;
and when I returned to the room above, active
preparations were still going on, which consumed much
time. The improvised tables were neatly covered with
white cloths, and hanging lamps shed down light upon
the scene. Piles of tin pans were placed upon the table,
knives, forks, and spoons, and sometimes a bowl. The
tables, with their seats, occupied nearly the whole floor
of the church, leaving but little room for spectators.
I was myself crowded into a corner, where the stairs
came up from the basement and went up to the loft;
but, though at times I was much pressed for room, I
had an excellent place to observe, for I stood at the end
of the main table. Here stood, too, a bright and social
sister from a neighboring congregation, who did not partake
of the feast, and was able and willing to explain
the ceremonial to me, in English,—Mrs. R., as I will
call her.</p>

<p>Near by at the table, among the older sisters, sat a
pair who attracted a great deal of my attention—a young
mother and her babe—herself so quiet, and such a quiet
babe! They might have been photographed. Once or
twice the little six-weeks’ child gave a feeble young wail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and I saw the youthful mother modestly give it that
nourishment which nature provides.</p>

<p>The brethren came up carrying tubs of meat, which
smelt savory, for I had fasted from flesh since the morning.
Then came great vessels of soup,—one of them a
very large tin wash-boiler. The soup was taken out into
the tin pans before mentioned, and the plates of meat
were set upon the top, as if to keep both hot. And, now
that “at long last” the Love-Feast tables were spread,
the fasting family was ready to begin, not the supper,
but the feet-washing! This was the more remarkable,
because the Testament, their rule of action, relates that
“supper being ended,” Jesus washed the disciples’ feet.</p>

<p>The bishop arose in his place at the table, and, lamp
in one hand and book in the other, read in German the
account of the feet-washing in John’s gospel.</p>

<p>Four men who stood in front of him, watching his
words, started when he said “legte seine Kleider ab”
(“laid aside his garments”), and, in imitation of Jesus,
took off their coats; and, as the Scripture says, “He
took a towel and girded himself,” they, or two of them,
put on long white aprons tied around the waist. Two
washed feet and two wiped, and then he who was thus
ministered unto was kissed by one or both of the ministering
brethren. I was a little surprised that two
should perform that office, which Jesus is said to have
performed alone: but Mrs. R. told me that, as the
church was one body, it was considered that it made no
difference to have two persons.</p>

<p>The four who had ministered took their seats, and
were served in their turn, four others taking their places,
and so on. Upon the sisters’ side of the house, on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
front bench, the sisters were, in a similar manner, performing
the same ordinance.</p>

<p>While the religious services of the evening were
going on within, from without there came the sound of
voices and laughter,—from where the young people <i>of
the world</i> were enjoying themselves in the clear, cool
moonlight. I doubt not that, by this time, the girls
had recognized the presence of the young men.</p>

<p>Once there was a shriek or a yell, and Mrs. R. said,
“Oh, the drunken rowdies! there’s always some of them
here!”</p>

<p>Having heard of the non-resistant or <i>wehrlos</i> tenets of
the Dunkers, I wondered what they would do should
the disturbance without become very great and unpleasant.
Mrs. Murphy thought that the other people
would interfere in such a case,—that is, that those not
members would interest themselves to maintain order.
But on this point I afterward received information from
a brother, as I shall mention. The services were so
long that I told Mrs. R. I thought that the soup would
be cold. “Oh, no!” she said, “that won’t get cold so
soon.” So I ventured to put my finger against a pan
near me, and it was yet warm. She asked me, during
feet-washing, whether I did not think that I should feel
happy to be there, partaking of that exercise.</p>

<p>I answered, in a non-committal manner, that if I had
been brought up to such things, as she had been, I might
feel so, but that all my friends and acquaintances were
of a different mind. She rejoined, “But we must follow
Christ, and serve God, in spite of the world.” Even
after the feet were all washed, the fasting family could
not yet eat, on account of the protracted exhortations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>At length they broke their fast. From two to four
persons, each with a spoon, ate together from one pan of
soup, very quietly, fifty feeding like one, so to speak;
the absence of sound proceeding in part perhaps from
the absence of earthen plates. Then they cut from the
meat and from the quarter-loaves, and partook of the
butter, this being all the food. There was no salt nor
any other condiment. The occasional bowl was for
water. I suppose that most persons would think that
there had been enough kissing of the kind; but about
this time a young bishop, an assistant, stood up at the
centre of the main table, and after some remarks shook
hands with the sister upon his left and kissed the brother
upon his right, and from brother to brother, and from
sister to sister, the kiss went around the congregation.</p>

<p>The bishop, and this assistant, went around upon ours,
the women’s side, superintending this ceremony, as if to
see that none failed in this expression of unity, and that
it was conducted in an orderly manner. The last sister,
who has no one to kiss, goes forward and kisses the first
one, with whom the bishop had shaken hands, thus completing
the chain of unity. This was doubtless done
before the Communion, and showed that brotherly love
existed among these brethren, fitting them to partake of
the sacrament. I was also told that the latter half of
the afternoon meeting had been for self-examination on
the same subject.</p>

<p>About this time of the evening Mrs. R. told me that
if I would go down I could get some of the soup, as
there was plenty left. I was willing to partake, not
having had a regular supper, and I got a bowl of good
mutton-broth, containing rice or barley, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>After the Love-Feast, these “Old Brethren,” as they
are sometimes called, held the Communion. The bread
and wine were placed upon the general or main table—being
set before the bishops—and were covered with a
white cloth.</p>

<p>Before the celebration of the ordinance there was read
in German the passage of Scripture upon which it is
founded; and also, as it seemed to me, the narrative of
the crucifixion. The hymn now sung was an English
one, and the only one in our language that was sung by
the whole congregation during the two days’ meeting.
It was,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime, the assistant bishop divided the bread, or
cakes, which were unleavened and sweetened. He directed
the members, while eating the bread, to reflect
upon the sufferings of the Saviour. His manner was
devout and impressive. As he and Bishop D⸺
passed around among the women, distributing the bread,
the former repeated several times, in a sonorous voice,
these or similar words: “Das Brod das wir brechen ist
die Gemeinschaft des Leibes Christi.” (“The bread
that we break is the communion of the body of Christ.”)</p>

<p>The wine, which smelt strong, was the juice of the
grape, and was made in the neighborhood. An aged
bishop from another congregation made some observations,
and while speaking marked the length of something
upon his finger. Mrs. R. said that he was showing
the size of the thorns in the crown. She added,
“They are there yet.” I looked at her in much surprise,
wondering whether she believed in the preservation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of the actual thorns; whereupon she added, “They
grow there still. Did you never read it in Bausman’s
book on the Holy Land?—Bausman, the Reformed
preacher.” The simplicity of the surroundings upon
this occasion were, it seemed to me, in keeping with
those of the original supper, at which sat the “carpenter’s
son” and the fishermen.</p>

<p>When meeting was over, as I did not see my escort
to the public-house, and as I had been told that I could
stay here, I followed those who went above-stairs, and
received a bolster made of a grain-bag filled with hay or
straw. I shared it with Mrs. Murphy. Our bed was
composed of straw laid upon the floor, and covered, or
nearly so, with pieces of domestic carpet. We had a
coverlet to lay over us. I talked with some of the
other women who lay beside us, and could not get to
sleep immediately; but at last I slept so sweetly that it
was not agreeable to be disturbed at four o’clock, when,
by my reckoning, the sisters began to rise. When some
of these had gone down, I should perhaps have slept
again, had it not been for a continued talking upon the
men’s side of the partition, quite audible, as the partition
only ran up to a distance of some feet, not nearly
so high as the lofty ridge of the building. The voices
appeared to be those of a young man and one or two
boys, talking in the dialect. A woman near me laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said I.</p>

<p>“It’s too mean to tell,” she answered.</p>

<p>I surmise that the Dunker brethren had gone down
and left these youths. Although a baby was crying, I
lay still until two girls in Dunker caps—one ten years
old, the other twelve—came with a candle, looking at us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
smiling, and making remarks, perhaps thinking that it
was time for us to be up.</p>

<p>I asked the eldest what o’clock it was.</p>

<p>She did not know.</p>

<p>“What made you get up, then?”</p>

<p>“I got up when the others did.”</p>

<p>Then some one explained that there were a good many
dishes left unwashed the evening before.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see such young persons members
of the meeting, for I supposed that the Dunkers, like
the Mennonites, are opposed to infant baptism. The
former explained to me, however, that they thought
such persons as these old enough to distinguish right
from wrong. I was told, too, of one girl, still younger,
who had insisted on <i>wearing the cap</i>. The Mennonites
baptize persons as young as fifteen. Both sects seem to
hold peculiar views upon original sin.</p>

<p>A Dunker preacher once said to me,—</p>

<p>“We believe that, after Adam, all were born in sin;
but, after Christ, all were born without sin.”</p>

<p>And a Mennist neighbor says,—</p>

<p>“Children have no sin; the kingdom of heaven is of
little children.”</p>

<p>I continued to lie still, looking at the rafters and roof,
and speculating as to their being so clean, and clear of
cobwebs, and whether they had been laboriously swept;
and then, gathering my wardrobe together with some
little trouble, I was at last ready to go down. As I
went to a window, I saw Orion and Sirius, and the
coming day.</p>

<p>Going down to wash at the pump, in the morning
gloaming, while the landscape still lay in shade, I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
two or three lads at the pump, and one of them pumped
for me. I was so ignorant of pump-washing as to
wonder why he pumped so small a stream, and to suspect
that he was <i>making fun</i>; but thus it seems it is
proper to do, to avoid wetting the sleeves.</p>

<p>Here I met a pretty young sister, from Cumberland
County,—fat and fair,—whose acquaintance I had made
the day before. Her cap was of lace, and not so plain
as the rest. There was with her at the pump one of the
world’s people, a young girl in a blue dress.</p>

<p>“Is that your sister?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It’s the daughter of the woman I live with,” she
replied. “I have no sister. I am hired with her
mother.”</p>

<p>To my inexperienced eye it was not easy to tell the
rich Dunkers from the poor, when all wore so plain a
dress. I was afterward much surprised on discovering
that this pretty sister did not understand German.
Another from Cumberland County told me that I
ought to come to their meeting, which was nearly all
English.</p>

<p>After washing, I went up into the meeting-house,
where the lamps were still burning. A few sisters were
sitting here, and two little maidens were making a baby
laugh and scream by walking her back and forth along
the empty benches. About sunrise the bishop had arrived,
and a number of brethren ranged themselves upon
the benches and began to sing. Before long, we, who had
stayed overnight, had our breakfast, having cold meat
at this and the succeeding meal. I think it was at breakfast
that my pleasant friend with the silvery hair mentioned
that there was still a store of bread and pies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>The great event of the morning meeting was the
“making the preacher.” At my usual seat, at a distant
window, I was so busily occupied with my notes that I
did not perceive what was going on at the preachers’
table, until I saw a man and woman standing before
the table with their backs to the rest of the congregation.
I made my way to my former corner of observation,
and found that there was another brother standing
with them (the sister in the middle), and these were
receiving the greetings of the family. The brethren
came up, one by one, kissed one of the men, shook
hands with the sister, and kissed the other man. This
last was the newly-chosen preacher, the former brother,
named Z., being a preacher who, by the consent of the
members (also given yesterday), was now advanced one
degree in the ministry, and was henceforth to have power
to marry and to baptize. The sister was his wife. She
is expected to support her husband in the ministry, and
to be ready to receive those women who, after baptism,
come up from the water. This office and that of voting
seem to be the only important ones held by women in
this society. Herein they differ greatly from another
plain sect,—Friends or Quakers, among whom women
minister, transact business, etc.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>After the brethren were done, the sisters came up,
shook hands with Z., kissed his wife, and shook hands
with the new preacher, whose wife, I believe, was not
present.</p>

<p>The bishop invited the sisters to come forward:
“Koomet alle! alle die will. Koomet alle!”</p>

<p>While this salutation was in progress, L., who spoke
in English, made some explanatory remarks. He told
us that he had read or heard of two men travelling together,
of whom one was a doctor of divinity. The
latter asked the younger man what he was now doing.
He replied that he was studying divinity. He had formerly
been studying law, but on looking around he saw
no opening in the law, so he was now studying divinity,
which course or which change met the approval of the
reverend doctor.</p>

<p>“Now,” said L., “<i>we</i> do not approve of men-made
preachers;” a striking remark in a congregation where
a preacher had just been elected by a plurality. But he
went on to explain that he trusted that there was no
brother or sister who had voted for him who had just
been chosen for this arm of the church who had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
prayed God earnestly that they might make such a
choice as would be profitable in the church. He went
on to explain that the newly-chosen preacher was now
receiving from the congregation an expression of unity.</p>

<p>There were various other exercises this morning,—preaching,
praying, and singing,—before the final adjournment.
At the close we had dinner. I made an
estimate of the number who partook of this meal as
about five hundred and fifty. One of the men guessed
a thousand; but we are prone to exaggerate numbers
where our feelings are interested.</p>

<p>Before we parted, I had some conversation with certain
brethren, principally upon the non-resistant doctrines
of the society. In my own neighborhood, not a great
while before, a Dunker had been robbed under peculiar
circumstances. Several men had entered his house at
night, and, binding him and other members of the
family, had forced him to tell where his United States
and other bonds were placed, and had carried off property
worth four thousand dollars. The brother had
gone in pursuit of them, visiting the mayor of our town,
and the police in neighboring cities (without recovering
his property). I asked these brethren at different times
whether his course was in agreement with their rules.
They answered that it was not.</p>

<p>On the present occasion I repeated the question as to
what they would have done on the previous evening if
the disturbance had risen to a great height. One of the
brethren, in reply, quoted from the Acts of the Apostles,
where it is narrated that forty Jews entered into a conspiracy
to kill Paul. But Paul sent his nephew to the
chief captain to inform him of the conspiracy. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
captain then put Paul under the charge of soldiers, to
be brought safe unto Felix the governor.</p>

<p>From this passage the Dunkers feel at liberty to appeal
to the police for their protection; but only once: if
protection be not then afforded them, they must do without
it.</p>

<p>I further mentioned to these brethren a case which
had been told to me some time before by a Dunker
preacher, of a certain brother who had been sued in the
settlement of an estate, and had received a writ from
the sheriff. This writ was considered by the Dunkers
as a call from the powers that be, to whom they are
ordered to be subservient, and the brother therefore
went with some brethren to the office of a lawyer, who
furnished him with subpœnas to summon witnesses in
his defence. But the Dunkers argued among themselves
that for him to take these legal papers from his
pocket would be to draw the sword. He therefore sent
word to his friends, informally, to come to the office of a
magistrate; and, the evidence being in his favor, he was
released. “This,” said my informant, “is the only lawsuit
that I have known in our society since I joined the
meeting,” which was, I believe, a period of about seven
years.</p>

<p>In repeating this narrative to the brethren at the
Love-Feast, I learned that they are now at liberty to
engage in defensive lawsuits. They have, as I understood
one to say, no creed and no discipline, although
I believe that a certain confession of faith is required.
The New Testament, or, as they say, the Testament,
they claim to be their creed and their discipline. There
is also much independence in the congregations. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
in some cases they have resort to a general council, and
here it has been decided that a Dunker may defend
himself in a lawsuit, but only once. Should an appeal
be taken to another court, the Dunker can go no further.
This reminds me of Paul’s question to the Corinthians,
“Why do you not rather suffer loss than go to law?”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Does it not seem hard to practise such non-resistance, to
remain upright and open-minded, and at the same time
to acquire much wealth?</p>

<p>The Dunkers do not like to be called by this name;
their chosen title is Brethren.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Love-Feast, above described, was held by the
“Old Brethren,” who originated in Germany about the
year 1708.</p>

<p>It has been said that they originated among the
Pietists; but a very great resemblance will be found
among them to our German Baptists of the Mennonite
or Anabaptist stock.</p>

<p>I afterward visited other Dunkers, belonging to a
division called the “River Brethren.” They originated
near the Susquehanna River, but they have now spread
as far as Ohio, if not farther.</p>

<p>That these are of the old Baptist stock there is no
doubt, as Jacob Engle, their founder, was of a Mennonite
family,—a family which boasts that one of their
ancestors was a prisoner in Switzerland, on account of
her faith. (See note, in “Swiss Exiles,” <a href="#Page_101">page 101</a>.)</p>

<p>In coming to this country, about one hundred years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
ago, tradition tells us that the Engle family joined with
thirty others, who were upon the same vessel, to remain
bound together in life and in death. The young infants
of these families all died upon the voyage, except Jacob
Engle, whereupon an old nurse said, “God has preserved
him for an especial purpose.” He became a
preacher, and this his friends regarded as a fulfilment
of the prophecy.</p>

<p>Jacob Engle, or “Yokely Engle,” as he was sometimes
called, considered that there was not sufficient
warmth and zeal among the Mennonites at that time.
He became very zealous; experiencing, as he believed, a
change of heart.</p>

<p>Before he became a preacher, some joined him in
holding prayer-meetings. It was found that some wished
to be baptized by immersion, and the rite was thus performed
(whereas the Mennonites baptize by pouring).</p>

<p>A common observer would see very little difference
between these Brethren and the Old Dunkers. The
River Brethren allow all present to partake of the love-feast,
or paschal supper. Some of them have said that
the paschal supper is an expression of the love of God
to all mankind, and love toward all men constrains them
to invite all to partake thereof. But from the Lord’s
Supper they exclude all strangers.</p>

<p>Their meetings are usually held in private houses, or
in summer in barns.</p>

<p>Some of their preachers have been heard, upon rising
to speak, to declare that they intend to say only what
the Spirit teaches them.</p>

<p>One of their most striking peculiarities is their opposition
to the use of lightning-rods. A preacher said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
me, when talking upon this subject, “If God wishes to
preserve the building, he can preserve it without the
lightning-rod. If he does not wish to preserve it, I am
willing to submit to the result.” It has been thought
that an acquaintance with the laws of electricity would
remove the objection which they feel.</p>

<p>The Brinser Brethren were formed from the River
Brethren some years ago. They are popularly thus
called, from an able preacher named Matthias Brinser.
They erect meeting-houses, in preference, as I understand,
to meeting in private houses. Their church has
not opposed electrical conductors, though some members
feel conscientious in the matter.</p>

<p>The question of erecting meeting-houses seems to have
caused considerable trouble among the River Brethren.
A gentleman of our county remarked to me that the
custom of meeting in private houses is traditional among
our people, and dates from times of persecution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the foregoing was published, there has appeared
in the <i>Century</i> magazine, December, 1881, an article by
Dr. Seidensticker on the Ephrata Baptists. In this article
the author states that the Dunkers number in the
United States (for they have also missions in Europe)
about two hundred thousand souls, with nearly two
thousand ministers, none of whom receives a salary.
They have three collegiate institutions,—one in Pennsylvania,
one in Ohio, and one in Illinois.</p>

<p>He states that those who fail in business among the
Dunkers are aided to make a new effort, and such assistance
may be lent three times [twice?]. After the third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
failure, they take it to be the will of God that the unfortunate
brother shall not succeed. Dr. Seidensticker
says, too, that in the holy kiss of the Dunkers, the first
kiss among the women is applied by the minister to the
first sister’s hand, which differs from the statement that
I have made of the Love-Feast.</p>

</div>

<p>This quiet village in Lancaster County has been for
over a century distinguished as the seat of a Protestant
monastic institution, established by the Seventh-Day
German Baptists about the year 1738.</p>

<p>Conrad Beissel, the founder of the cloister, was born
in Germany, at Oberbach, in the Palatinate, in the year
1691. He was by trade a baker, but, after coming to
this country, he worked at weaving with Peter Becker,
the Dunker preacher, at Germantown. He is said to
have been a Presbyterian, which I interpret to mean a
member of the German Reformed Church. According
to the inscription upon his tombstone, his “spiritual life”
began in 1716, or eight years before he was baptized
among the Dunkers.</p>

<p>This may be explained by an article written by the
Rev. Christian Endress, who seems to have studied the
Ephrata community, in connection with their published
writings, more than some others who have endeavored
to describe this peculiar people.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Endress says, “The Tunkers trace their origin
from the Pietists near Schwarzenau, in Germany.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>While they yet belonged among the Pietists, there
was a society formed at Schwarzenau composed of eight
persons, whose spiritual leader was Alexander Mack, a
miller of Schriesheim.</p>

<p>The members of this little society are said to have
been rebaptized (by immersion), because they considered
their infant baptism as unavailing, and to have first
assumed the name of <i>Taeuffer</i>, or Baptists.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The Dunkers first appeared in America in 1719, when
about twenty families landed in Philadelphia, and dispersed
to Germantown, Conestoga, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Beissel was baptized among them in 1724, in Pequea
Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna. He lived for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
a while at Mühlbach, or Mill Greek, in Lancaster
County. Some time after this baptism, or in 1728, he
published a tract upon the Seventh Day as the true
Sabbath. This tract caused a disturbance among the
brethren at Mill Creek, and Beissel and some with him
withdrew from the other Dunkers, and Beissel rebaptized
those of his own society.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Not long after, says Endress, Beissel, who had appointed
several elders over his people, withdrew from
them, and retired to live a solitary life in a cottage that
had been built for a similar purpose, and occupied by a
brother called Elimelech. This cottage stood near the
place where the convent was afterward built. Here we
infer that he lived for several years.</p>

<p>To live the life of cenobites or hermits, says Rupp,
was in some measure peculiar to many of the Pietists
who had fled from Germany to seek an asylum in Pennsylvania.
“On the banks of the Wissahickon, near Philadelphia,
several hermits had their cells, some of them
men of fine talents and profound erudition.”</p>

<p>Of some of these hermits, and of the monastic community
afterward settled at Ephrata, it is probable that
a ruling idea was the speedy coming of Christ to judge
the world. It is stated that after the formation of Beissel’s
“camp” midnight meetings were held, for some
time, to await the coming of judgment. Those who remember
the Millerite, or Second Advent, excitement of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the year 1843, can appreciate the effect that this idea
would have upon the minds of the Dunkers, and how
it could stimulate them to suffer many inconveniences
for the brief season that they expected to tarry in the
world.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>While Beissel was dwelling in his solitary cot, about
the year 1730, two married women joined the society,
of whom the Ephrata Chronicle tells us that they left
their husbands and placed themselves under the lead
of the director (or <i>vorsteher</i>, the title applied to Beissel
in the Chronicle). He received them, although it
was against the canon of the new society. One of
these was Maria Christiana, wife of Christopher Sower,
him who afterward established the celebrated German
printing-office at Germantown. She escaped in the year
1730, and was baptized the same fall. In the beginning
she dwelt alone in the desert, “and showed by
her example that a manly spirit can dwell in a female
creature.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>While Beissel was still in his hermitage, discord and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
strife arose among the brethren of his society, news of
which reached him by some means, for in the year 1733
he cited them to appear at his cottage.</p>

<p>They met, and some of the single brethren agreed to
build a second cottage near that occupied by their leader.
Besides this, a house was also built for females, and in
May, 1733, two single women retired into it.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In 1734, a third house for male brethren was built
and occupied by the brothers Onesimus and Jotham,
whose family name was Eckerlin.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>Soon after, says Endress, they all united in the building
of a bake-house and a storehouse for the poor. And
now the whole was called the camp (<i>das Lager</i>).</p>

<p>The early history of the society is quaintly narrated
by Morgan Edwards, the Baptist historian. They had,
he says, their existence as a society in 1724, when Conrad
Beissel and six others were baptized in Pequea River
by Rev. Peter Baker. The same day these seven incorporated
into a church, and chose Conrad Beissel to be
their minister. After this they continued some time at
Mill Creek, and then, removing about three miles northward,
pitched on the land of Rudolph Neagley, in Earl
Township. Here they continued about seven years; and
hither resorted many to see them, some of whom joined
the society. Here they began their economy, the men
living by themselves on the fore-mentioned lands, and
the women also by themselves on the adjoining lands of
John Moyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>Here Conrad Beissel appointed two elders and a matron
to preside over his church in the wilderness, binding
them by a solemn promise (and at the same time giving
to each a Testament) to govern according to the rules of
that book. Then he withdrew, and made as though
they should see him no more. This was done in the
year 1732 or 1733. He travelled northward, till he
came to the spot where Ephrata or Tunkerstown now
stands, and with his hoe planted Indian corn and roots
for his subsistence. But he had not been long in the
place before the society found him out, and repaired to
his little cot, the brethren settling with him on the west
bank of Cocalico, and the sisters on the east, all in sight
of one another, with the river running between them.
The next year they set about building their village, beginning
with a place of worship.</p>

<p>Endress tells us that about the time of the formation
of the camp there was a revival in Falconer Swamp, in
consequence of which many families took up land round
about the camp, and moved upon it. Another revival
on the banks of the Schuylkill drove many more into
the neighborhood; by it the sister establishment gained
accessions; but only two, Drusilla and Basilla, remained
steadfast. “A further revival in Tolpehoccon,” 1735,
brought many to the society. Hereupon they built a
meeting-house, with rooms attached to it for the purpose
of holding [preparing?] love-feasts, and called it Kedar.
About the same time, a revival in Germantown sent
additional brothers and sisters to the camp.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>It was in 1735, during the revival at Tulpehocken,
that Peter Miller was baptized<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> or rebaptized. Miller,
in one of his letters (see Hazard’s Register, vol. xvi.),
speaks of several persons who, as it appears, were baptized
with him; namely, the schoolmaster, three <i>elderlings</i>
(one of them Conrad Weyser), five families, and
some single persons. This, he says, raised such a fermentation
in that church (by which I suppose he means
the Reformed Church, which they left), that a persecution
might have followed had the magistrates consented with
the generality.</p>

<p>Peter Miller, whom we are now quoting, was one of
the most remarkable men that joined the Ephrata Baptists.
He was born in the Palatinate, and is said to
have been educated at Heidelberg. He came to this
country when about twenty years old. He is mentioned,
it seems, in an interesting letter of the Rev. Jedediah
Andrews, under date of Philadelphia, 1730, which letter
may be found in Hazard’s Register. He says that there
are “in this province a vast number of Palatines. Those
that have come of late years are mostly Presbyterian, or,
as they call themselves, Reformed, the Palatines being
about three-fifths of that sort of people.”</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews says, in substance, “There is lately come
over a Palatine candidate for the ministry, who applied
to us at the Synod for ordination. He is an extraordinary
person for sense and learning. His name is John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Peter Miller,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and he speaks Latin as readily as we do
our vernacular tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Peter Miller, in one of his letters, speaks of his baptism
(or rebaptism) in the year 1735. He says at that
time the solitary brethren and sisters lived dispersed
“in the wilderness of Canestogues, each for himself, as
hermits, and I following that same way did set up my
hermitage in Dulpehakin [Tulpehocken], at the foot of
a mountain, on a limpid spring; the house is still extant
[1790], with an old orchard. There did I lay the
foundation of solitary life.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>“However,” he continues, “I had not lived there
half a year, when a great change happened; for a camp
was laid out for all solitary persons, at the very spot
where now Ephrata stands, and where at that same time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
the president [Beissel] lived with some hermits. And
now, when all hermits were called in, I also quitted my
solitude, and changed the same for a monastic life; which
was judged to be more inservient to sanctification than
the life of a hermit, where many under a pretence of
holiness did nothing but nourish their own selfishness....
We were now, by necessity, compelled to learn
obedience.... At that time, works of charity hath
been our chief occupation.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>“Canestogues was then a great wilderness, and began
to be settled by poor Germans, which desired our assistance
in building houses for them; which not only kept
us employed several summers in hard carpenter’s work,
but also increased our poverty so much that we wanted
even things necessary for life.”</p>

<p>He also says, “When we settled here, our number
was forty brethren, and about so many sisters, all in the
vigor and prime of their ages, never before wearied of
social life, but were compelled, ... with reluctance of
our nature, to select this life.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>It was, it seems, about the same time that Miller was
baptized that the midnight meetings were held at the
camp, “for the purpose of awaiting the coming of
judgment.”</p>

<p>Not long after the building of the meeting-house
called Kedar (says Endress), a widower, Sigmund Lambert,
having joined the camp, built out of his own
means an addition to the meeting-house and a dwelling
for Beissel. Another gave all his property to the society,
and now Kedar was transformed into a sister-convent,
and a new meeting-house was erected.</p>

<p>Soon after 1738 a large house for the brethren was
built, called Zion, and the whole camp was named
Ephrata.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The solitary life was changed into the conventual
one; Zion was called a kloster, or convent,
and put under monastic rules. Onesimus (Eckerlin)
was appointed prior, and Conrad Beissel named father.
(His general title appears to be <i>vorsteher</i>, superintendent
or principal.)</p>

<p>It was probably about this time, or earlier, that the
constable entered the camp, according to Miller, and
demanded the single man’s tax. Some paid, but some
refused. Miller says that some claimed personal immunity
on the ground that they were not inferior to the
monks and hermits in the Eastern country, who supplied
the prisons in Alexandria with bread, and who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
declared free of taxes by Theodosius the Great and
other emperors. But these Ephrata brethren were not
to be thus exempted. Six lay in prison at Lancaster
ten days, when they were released on bail of a “venerable
old justice of peace.” When the brethren appeared
before the board of assessment, the gentlemen who were
their judges saw six men who in the prime of their ages
had been reduced to skeletons by penitential works.
The gentlemen granted them their freedom on condition
that they should be taxed as one family for their real
estate, “which is still in force (1790), although these
things happened fifty years ago.” (See Miller’s letters
in Hazard’s Register.)</p>

<p>A monastic dress was adopted by the brethren and
sisters, resembling that of the Capuchins.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The Chronicle, published in 1786, speaks of the sisters
as having carefully maintained the dress of the order for
nearly fifty years. About the same date we read of
Miller in his cowl.</p>

<p>It appears from the Chronicle that the other members
of the society at one time adopted a similar dress, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
that the celibates (<i>die Einsamen</i>) appeared at worship
in white dresses, and the other members (<i>die Hausstände</i>)
in gray ones. The secular members, however, “saddled
themselves again” and conformed to the world in clothing
and in other things.</p>

<p>In an article upon Ephrata in Hazard’s Register, vol.
v., 1830, will be found the statement that, thirty or forty
years before, the Dunkers were occasionally noticed in
Philadelphia (when they came down with produce), with
long beards and Capuchin habiliments; but this statement
does not seem to agree in date with that of the
Chronicle, if these were secular brethren.</p>

<p>Among the austerities practised at Ephrata formerly,
was sleeping upon a bench with a block of wood for a
pillow.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The late Dr. William Fahnestock tells us that these
and other austerities were not intended for penance, but
were undertaken from economy. Their circumstances
were very restricted, and their undertaking was great.
They studied the strictest simplicity and economy.
For the Communion they used wooden flagons, goblets,
and trays. The plates from which they ate were thin
octagonal pieces of poplar board, their forks and
candlesticks were of wood, and every article that could
be made of that substance was used by the whole community.</p>

<p>Rupp says that the chimneys, which remain in use to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
this day (1844), are of wood; and the attention of the
present writer was called in 1872 to wooden door-hinges.</p>

<p>Rupp says also that they all observed great abstemiousness
in their diet; they were vegetarians, and
submitted to many privations and to a rigid discipline
exerted over them by a somewhat austere spiritual
father. Peter Miller himself says that he stood under
Beissel’s direction for thirty years, and that it was as
severe as any related in the Romish Church (but this
sounds exaggerated).</p>

<p>In the brother- and sister-houses, it has been stated
that six dormitories surrounded a common room in
which the members of each subdivision pursued their
respective employments. “Each dormitory was hardly
large enough to contain a cot, a closet, and an hour-glass.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Of the industries established at Ephrata, one of Peter
Miller’s letters gives us a good idea. He complains, as
before mentioned, of Eckerlin’s obliging them to interfere
so far in worldly things, and that money was put out at
interest. He adds that they erected a grist-mill, with
three pairs of stones; a saw-mill, paper-mill, oil-mill,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and fulling-mill; had besides three wagons with proper
teams, a printing-office, and sundry other trades.</p>

<p>He adds, “Our president [by whom he means Beissel]
never meddled with temporal things.”</p>

<p>Mr. Rupp (who cites the Life of Rittenhouse) says
that the women were employed in spinning, knitting,
sewing, making paper lanterns and other toys. A room
was set apart for ornamental writing, called “Das Schreibzimmer,”
and “several sisters,” it has been said, devoted
their whole attention to this labor, as well as to transcribing
the writings of the founder of the society; thus
multiplying copies before they had a press. But the
press appears to have been early established, and it was
the second German one in our State. It has been stated
that Miller was at one time the printer.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Among the books published at Ephrata were some of
Beissel’s, who had adopted the name of Peaceful (<i>Friedsam</i>).
One of their publications was a collection of
hymns, and was entitled “The Song of the Solitary
and Abandoned Turtle Dove, namely, the Christian
Church, ... by a Peaceful Pilgrim travelling towards
Quiet Eternity.” Ephrata, from the press of the Fraternity,
1747. 500 pages, quarto.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>Beissel also wrote a dissertation on man’s fall, of
which Miller says (1790), “When, in the late war, a
marquis from Milan, in Italy, lodged a night in our
convent, I presented to him the said dissertation, and
desired him to publish it at home, and dedicate it to his
Holiness.”</p>

<p>In 1748, a stupendous book was published by the
society at Ephrata. It is the Martyr’s Mirror, in folio,
of which copies may be seen at the libraries of the Pennsylvania
Historical Society, and of the German Society,
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The Chronicon Ephratense, or Ephrata Chronicle, so
often alluded to in this article, was also from their press,
but was published thirty-eight years later. It contains
the life of Beissel, under the title of the venerable
“Father in Christ, Peaceful Godright (<i>Friedsam Gottrecht</i>),
late founder and <i>vorsteher</i> of the Spiritual Order
of the Solitary (<i>Einsamen</i>) in Ephrata, collected by
Brothers Lamech and Agrippa.” I have heard of several
copies being still extant,—one in Lancaster County,
one in Montgomery, and one in the library of the Historical
Society at Philadelphia. The last I have been
allowed to consult.</p>

<p>In speaking of the occupations practised at Ephrata,
it may be permitted to include music. Beissel is said to
have been an excellent musician and composer. “There
was another transcribing-room,” says Fahnestock, “appropriated
to copying music. Hundreds of volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
each containing five or six hundred pieces, were transferred
from book to book, with as much accuracy, and
almost as much neatness, as if done with the graver.”
In composing music, Beissel is said to have taken his
style from nature.  “The singing is the Æolian harp
harmonized.... Their music is set in four, six, and
eight parts.”</p>

<p>Morgan Edwards<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> (as cited in Day’s Historical Collections)
says, “Their singing is charming,—partly owing
to the pleasantness of their voices, the variety of parts
they carry on together, and the devout manner of performance.”
This style of singing is said by Rupp
(1844) to be entirely lost at Ephrata, but to be preserved
in a measure at Snow Hill, in Franklin County. Fahnestock,
who was himself a Seventh-Day Baptist (or <i>Siebtaeger</i>),
gives a very enthusiastic account of the singing
at Snow Hill. It may be found in Day’s Historical
Collections, article “Franklin County.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the various industries which claimed the
attention of the community, there must not be forgotten
the care of their landed estate. It has been said that
they bought about two hundred and fifty acres of land.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>A very large tract was once offered to them by one of
the Penns, but they refused it. I was told at Ephrata
that they were “afraid they would get too vain.”</p>

<p>Count Zinzendorf, the celebrated Moravian bishop,
came to Pennsylvania in 1741. At one time he visited
Ephrata, and was entertained in the convent, where his
friendly behavior was very agreeable to the brothers.
(We may suppose that Miller, and Eckerlin, who was
not yet deposed, were men fit to entertain him.) He
also expressed a wish to see Beissel. This was made
known to the latter, who answered, after a little reflection,
that Zinzendorf was no wonder to him, but if he
himself were a wonder to Zinzendorf, he must come to
him (or as it seems, to Beissel’s own house). Zinzendorf
was now in doubt what to do, but he turned away and
left without seeing the father (<i>vorsteher</i>). The Chronicle
adds that thus did two great lights of the church
meet as on the threshold, and yet neither ever saw the
other in his life.</p>

<p>The Moravians also erected brother- and sister-houses,
but they were not monastic institutions.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>Dissension arose at one time between some of the
brethren of the Ephrata Society and Count Zinzendorf,
at a conference held by the latter at Oley, now
in Berks County. Zinzendorf seems to have desired to
unite some of the sects with which Pennsylvania was
so abundantly supplied. But the solitary brethren (of
Ephrata) were so suspicious of the thing that they would
no longer unite with it. They had prepared a writing
upon marriage, how far it is from God, and that it was
only a praiseworthy ordinance of nature. This they
presented, whereupon there arose a violent conflict in
words.</p>

<p>The ordinarius (Zinzendorf) said that he was by no
means pleased with this paper; his marriage had not
such a beginning; his marriage stood higher than the
solitary life in Ephrata. The Ephrata delegates strove
to make all right again, and spoke of families in their
society who had many children.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>But Zinzendorf left his seat as chairman, ... and at
last the conference came to an end, all present being
displeased.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>About this date (or about 1740) took place the formation
of the Sabbath-school, by Ludwig Hoecker, called
Brother Obed.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> He was a teacher in the secular school
at Ephrata,—a school which seems to have enjoyed
considerable reputation. The Sabbath-school (held on
Saturday afternoon) is said to have been kept up over
thirty years. This was begun long before the present
Sunday-school system was introduced by Robert Raikes.
(American Cyclopædia, article <i>Dunkers</i>.)</p>

<p>Not long after the visit of Zinzendorf, or about 1745,
occurred the deposition of Eckerlin, the prior Onesimus.
In one of his letters, Miller says (1790), “Remember,
we have lost our first prior and the sisters their first
mother ... because they stood in self-elevation, and
did govern despotically;” and adds, “the desire to
govern is the last thing which dies within a man.” (It
seems probable that Eckerlin has not received sufficient
credit, however, for the pecuniary success of the infant
community.)</p>

<p>Some ten years after his deposition (or in 1755),
began the old French and Indian war. Fahnestock
tells us that the doors of the cloister, including the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
chapels, etc., were opened as a refuge for the inhabitants
of Tulpehocken and Paxton<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> settlements, which were
then the frontiers, to protect the people from the incursions
of the hostile Indians. He adds that all these
refugees were received and kept by the society during
the period of alarm and danger. Upon hearing of
which, a company of infantry was despatched by the
royal government from Philadelphia to protect Ephrata.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But why, we might ask, did these people seek refuge
in a communion of non-combatants? The question
bears on the controversy, as to whether the men of peace
or the men of war were nearer right in their dealings
with the savages.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Beissel died in the year 1768, or about thirty years
after the establishment of the cloister. Upon his tombstone
was placed, in German, this inscription:</p>

<p>“Here rests a Birth of the love of God, Peaceful, a
Solitary, but who afterward became a Superintendent of
the Solitary Community of Christ in and around Ephrata:
born in Oberbach in the Palatinate, and named Conrad
Beissel.”</p>

<p>“He fell asleep the 6th of July, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1768: of his
spiritual life 52, but of his natural one, 77 years and
4 months.”</p>

<p>Endress says, “He appears to me to have been a man
possessed of a considerable degree of the spirit of rule;
his mind bent from the beginning upon the acquirement
of authority, power, and ascendency.” For ourselves,
we have just seen how he received Count Zinzendorf,
who had crossed the ocean, and come, as it were, to his
threshold.</p>

<p>Mr. Endress further says, “Beissel, good or bad,
lived and died the master-spirit of the brotherhood.
With him it sank into decay.”</p>

<p>The British officer who wrote in 1786 (?), eighteen
years after Beissel’s death, gives the number of the celibates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
as seven men and five women. I do not consider
him good authority; but if the numbers were so much
reduced from those of 1740, it seems probable that they
had begun to decline before the decease of Beissel.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Eighteen years after Beissel’s death, was published at
Ephrata the Chronicle of which I have so often spoken,
giving an account of his life. He was succeeded by
Peter Miller. Miller was sixty-five years old when
our Revolutionary war broke out, and had been the
leader at Ephrata seven years.</p>

<p>Fahnestock says that after the battle of Brandywine
“the whole establishment was opened to receive the
wounded Americans, great numbers of whom (Rupp
says four or five hundred) were brought here in wagons
a distance of more than forty miles, and one hundred
and fifty of whom died and are buried on Mount
Zion.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is also narrated that before the battle of Germantown
a quantity of unbound books were seized at Ephrata by
some of our soldiers, in order to make cartridges. “An
embargo,” says Miller, “was laid on all our printed
paper, so that for a time we could not sell any printed
book.”</p>

<p>A story has appeared in print, and not always in the
same manner, about Miller’s going to General Washington
and receiving from him a pardon for his old enemy
Widman, who was condemned to die.</p>

<p>This story Mr. Rupp thinks is based upon tradition;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
one version has been told in a glowing manner, and is
attributed to Dr. Fahnestock. It runs thus: On the
breaking out of the Revolution, committees of safety
were formed in different districts to support our cause.
At the head of the Lancaster County Committee was
Michael Widman, who kept a public house, and who
had been a vestryman in the Reformed Church. This
church Miller had left when he joined the Baptists.
He persecuted Miller to a shameful extent, even spitting
in his face when he met him.</p>

<p>Widman was at first bold and active in the cause of
independence, but he became discouraged, and resolved
to go to Philadelphia and conciliate General Howe, the
British commander, who then held that city. Howe,
however, declined his services,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but gave orders to see
him safely beyond the British outposts. His treasonable
intentions having become known to the Americans, he
was arrested and taken to the nearest block-house, at the
Turk’s Head, now West Chester; was tried by court-martial,
and sentenced to be hung. Peter Miller, hearing
of his arrest, went to General Washington and
pleaded for mercy towards him. The general answered
that the state of public affairs was such as to make it
necessary that renegades should suffer, “otherwise I
should most cheerfully release your friend.”</p>

<p>“Friend!” exclaimed Miller: “he is my worst enemy,—my
incessant reviler.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Said the general, “My dear friend, I thank you for
this example of Christian charity!” and he granted
Miller’s petition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to go further, and describe
the scene of Miller’s arriving upon the ground with the
pardon just as Widman was to be hung, nor the subsequent
proceedings there, for I am quite sure that they
did not take place. Evidence to this effect is found in
the Pennsylvania Archives, vol. ix., where Peter Miller
writes to Secretary Matlack, interceding (apparently) for
a man named Rein. Miller says, “I have thought his
case was similar to Michael Wittman’s, who received
pardon without a previous trial.”</p>

<p>The secretary replies (1781), “Witman did not receive
a pardon previous to a surrender.”</p>

<p>Thus it seems that the story of Widman’s trial by
court-martial is also wrong. That his property was confiscated,
as I was lately told at Ephrata, I have no reason
to doubt, as the Colonial Records, vol. xii., show
that in council, in 1779, it was resolved that the agents
for forfeited estates should sell that of Michael Wittman,
subject to a certain claim.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>At Ephrata, during the past winter, I stood in the
loft of the brother-house beside a great chimney of wood
and clay, and was told that here Widman had been hidden.
Whether he actually concealed himself in the
brother-house, as has been narrated, I do not find that
history declares.</p>

<p>At a subsequent date, 1783, we find in the Pennsylvania
Archives, vol. ix., that Miller intercedes for certain
Mennonites who had been fined for not apprehending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
British deserters; the Mennonites not being permitted
by their principles to do so. Does this mean deserters
from ourselves to the British,—who were, as deserters,
liable to the punishment of death? a punishment which
the Mennonites, as non-resistants, could not inflict.</p>

<p>Certain letters of Peter Miller, published in Hazard’s
Register, and of which I have made considerable use,
were written at an advanced age,—eighty or thereabout.
He says in one of them (December, 1790), “Age, infirmity,
and defect in sight are causes that the letter
wants more perspicuity, for which I beg pardon.”</p>

<p>He died about six years after, having lived some sixty
years a member of the community at Ephrata. Upon
his tombstone was placed this inscription in German:</p>

<p>“Here lies buried Peter Miller, born in Oberampt
Lautern, in the Palatinate (Chur-Pfalz); came as a Reformed
preacher to America in the year 1730; was baptized
by the Community at Ephrata in the year 1735,
and named Brother Jaebez; also he was afterward a
preacher (<i>Lehrer</i>) until his end. He fell asleep the 25th
of September, 1796, at the age of eighty-six years and
nine months.”</p>

<p>In the plain upon the banks of the Cocalico still stand
the brother- and sister-houses (although not the buildings
first erected). But the society is feeble in numbers, and
the buildings are going to decay. They are still, however,
occupied, or partly so. I found several women
living here in 1872. Some of these were never married,
but the majority are widows; and not all of them members
of the Baptist congregation. Nor are the voices of
children wanting.</p>

<p>The last celibate brother died some forty years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
One, indeed, has been here since, but, as I was told, “he
did not like it,” and went to the more flourishing community
of Snow Hill, in Franklin County.</p>

<p>The little Ephrata association (which still owns a
farm), instead of supporting its unmarried members,
now furnishes to them only house-rent, fuel, and flour.
The printing-press long since ceased from its labors, and
many of the other industrial pursuits have declined.</p>

<p>No longer do the unmarried or celibate members own
all the property, but it is now vested in all who belong
to the meeting, single and married, and is in the hands
of trustees. The income is, I presume, but small.</p>

<p>The unmarried members wear our usual dress, and
none are strictly recluse.</p>

<p>Formerly a large room or chapel was connected with
the brother-house. It was furnished with galleries,
where sat the sisters, while the brethren occupied the
floor below. (This building, I am told, is not standing.)
In the smaller room or chapel (<i>saal</i>) connected with the
sister-house, about twenty people now meet on the Seventh
day for public worship. But among all these changes
the German language still remains! All the services
that I heard, while attending here in February of 1872,
were in that tongue, except two hymns at the close. We
must not suppose that this language is employed because
the members are natives of Germany. One or two may
be, but the preacher’s father or grandfather came to this
country when a boy.</p>

<p>Around the meeting-room are hung charts or sheets
of grayish paper, containing German verses in ornamental
writing, the ancient labors of the celibates, or perhaps of
the sisters alone. One small chart here is said to represent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
the three heavens, and to contain three hundred
figures in Capuchin dress, with harps in their hands, and
two hundred archangels. Perhaps this and their celibate
doctrine are drawn, at least in part, from the opening of
chapter xiv. of the book called the Revelation of John.</p>

<p>But for these old labors in pen and ink, the chapel is
as plain as a Quaker meeting-house. It is kept beautifully
clean.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Opening out of it is a kitchen, furnished
with the apparatus for cooking and serving the simple
repasts of the love-feasts. Among these Baptists, love-feasts
are held not only, as I understand, in a similar
manner to the other Dunkers, but upon funeral occasions,—a
short period after the interment of a brother or
sister. Rupp speaks of their eating lamb and mutton
at their paschal feasts. In the old monastic time, it was
only at love-feasts that the celibate brothers and sisters
met.</p>

<p>Here I was shown a wooden goblet made by the
brethren for the Communion. It has been said that they
preferred to use such, even after more costly ones had
been given to them.</p>

<p>After attending the religions services in the chapel,
three or four of us—strangers—were supplied with
dinner in the brother-house, at a neat and well-filled
table.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>I afterward sat for an hour in the neat and comfortable
apartment of Sister Sarah in the sister-house. Here
she has lived twenty-two years, and, though now much
advanced in life, has not that appearance. She seemed
lovely, and, I was told, had not been unsought. One
of her brothers has been thirty-three years at the Snow
Hill community.</p>

<p>Sister Sarah produced for me a white cotton over-dress,
such as was formerly worn by the sisters. It was
a cap or cowl, with long pieces hanging down in front
and behind nearly to the feet; and, if I remember it
right, not of the pattern described in the Chronicle. But
fashions change in fifty to a hundred years.</p>

<p>She also showed me some verses recently written by
one of the brethren at Snow Hill. They were in German,
of which I offer an unrhymed version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh divine life, ornament of virginity!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How art thou despised by all men here below!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet art a branch from the heavenly throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And borne by the virgin Son of God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was surprised to find such prominence given to the
idea of the merits of celibacy, for I had not then seen
the <i>Chronicon Ephratense</i>.</p>

<p>One object which especially attracted my attention was
an upright clock, which stood in the room of Sister
Sarah, and which was kept in very good order. It was
somewhat smaller than the high clocks that were common
forty or fifty years ago.</p>

<p>All that I heard of its history was that it had come
from Germany. It had four weights suspended on
chains. Above the dial-plate hovered two little angels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
apparently made of lead, one on either side of a small
disk, which bore the inscription “Hoeckers a Creveld,”—as
I interpret, made by the Hoeckers at Crefeld.
Crefeld,—historic town! Here then was a relic of it,
and standing quite disregarded,—it was only an old
German clock!</p>

<p>When the Dunkers were persecuted in Europe, soon
after their establishment, some of them took refuge in
Crefeld, in the duchy of Cleves; and I have lately read
that in Crefeld, Mühlheim, etc., William Penn and
others gained adherents to the doctrine of the Quakers.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>We also find in the American Cyclopædia that at
Crefeld (Ger. <i>Krefeld</i>), a colony of Huguenot refugees
in the seventeenth century introduced the manufacture of
silk—Dunkers and Quakers; perhaps also Huguenots
fleeing from France when Louis XIV. revoked that
edict of Nantes which had so long protected them.
(Crefeld is now in Rhenish Prussia.)</p>

<p>Who were the Hoeckers, or who was the Hoecker that
made this old clock?<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Who bought it in historic Crefeld?
Who brought it from Europe, got it up into
Lancaster County, and lodged it in the monastery or
nunnery at Ephrata? What, if anything, had Ludwig
Hoecker or Brother Obed to do with it—he who taught
the early Sabbath-school? What tales could it not tell!
But it is well cared for in the comfortable apartment of
the kindly sister.</p>

<p>The Snow Hill settlement, I presume, is named from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the family of Snowberger,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> one of whom endowed the
society. It is situated on the Antietam, in Franklin
County, Pennsylvania; where a large farm belongs to
“the nunnery” (an expression that I heard at Ephrata).
There were, until lately, five sisters and four brothers at
Antietam, but one of the brethren has died.</p>

<p>The brethren have sufficient occupation in taking care
of their property; the sisters keep house, eating in the
same apartment at the same time with the brothers.
Under these circumstances I could imagine the comfort
and order of the establishment, and think of the brothers
and sisters meeting in a cool and shaded dining-room.
What question then should I be likely to ask? This
one: “Do they never marry?”</p>

<p>I was told that marriages of the brothers and sisters
(celibates) are not unknown; but I also understood that
such a thing is considered backsliding. Persons thus
married remain members of the church, but must leave
the community, and find support elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In an article by Redmond Conyngham (Hazard’s
Register, vol. v.) will be found the statement that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
“President of the Dunkers” says, “We deny eternal
punishment; those souls who become sensible of God’s
great goodness and clemency, and acknowledge his lawful
authority, ... and that Christ is the only true
Son of God, are received into happiness; but those
who continue obstinate are kept in darkness until the
great day, when light will make all happy.” According
to Dr. Fahnestock, however, the idea of a universal
restoration, which existed in the early days, is not now
publicly taught.</p>

<p>The observance of the Seventh day as a sabbath must
always be onerous, in a community like ours. Hired
people are not required by the Siebentaeger (or Seventh-Day
men) to work on Saturday; and, unless of their
own persuasion, will not work on Sunday.</p>

<p>It has been said that the customs at Ephrata resembled
the Judaic ones; and Endress says that they consider
baptism similar to purification in the Mosaic law,—as a
rite which may be repeated from time to time when the
believer has become defiled by the world, and would
again renew his union with Christ. But Miller says
(1790), “Our standard is the New Testament.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Fahnestock says that they do not approve of paying
their ministers; and it seems that the women, or at least
the single sisters, are at liberty to speak in religious
meetings.</p>

<p>In the correspondence of one of our Lancaster papers
of 1871, there was given the following account: “Ephrata,
May 21.—The Society of the Seventh-Day Baptists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
held their semi-annual love-feast yesterday, when one
new member was added to the society by immersion.
In the evening the solemn feast of the Lord’s Supper
was celebrated, the occasion attracting a large concourse
of people,—only about half of whom could obtain seats.
The conduct of a number of persons on the outside was
a disgrace to an intelligent community.”</p>

<p>The article also mentions preachers as present from
Bedford, Franklin, and Somerset Counties. However,
the whole number of the Seventh-Day German Baptists,
in our State, is very small.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing article is published nearly as it appeared
in the second edition of this volume. In the present year,
1882, Mr. Adam Konigmacher Fahnestock, of Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, has lent me a little memorial which
he had prepared of his own family. A passage in it
seems to elucidate the history of the clock at Ephrata,
which bears on its face “Hoeckers a Creveld.” On St.
John’s day, November 13, 1753, Diedrich Fanestuck
writes to his brother in Prussia. (The letter is said to
have been written near Ephrata.) He writes that his
son, who is going to Europe, will stop at Crefeld, “where
he is to have some clocks made for us.” He adds, “I
pray you to write again. You may send the letters to
Crefeld, there are three brothers living there, Wilhelmus,
Christophorus, and Lucas Heckers, to them you
might send them.”</p>

<p>In a foot-note A. K. Fahnestock says, 1878, October
17: “I had the pleasure this day of seeing one of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
clocks (seven feet high), still showing the time of day.
It is in the ‘sister-house’ at Ephrata.” (The preposition
a on the clock, Hoeckers a Creveld, would seem to indicate
that this Hoeckers were French refugees. Perhaps
with a translated name.)</p>

<p class="tb">In this year, 1882, the writer of this volume again
visited Ephrata. One of her acquaintance spoke to her
of the community at Snow Hill, on the Antietam. She
said, “It’s a large nunnery, and the rooms are all empty;
there’s hardly any one there.” She added, however, that
there are a good many married Seventh-Day Baptists at
Snow Hill.</p>

<p>The old buildings at Ephrata, the brother- and sister-house,
are still kept in sufficient repair to make inmates
comfortable, and are occupied by unmarried women,
widows, and families; not all Seventh-Day Baptists.
The farm belonging to the Baptists contains about eighty
acres.</p>

<p>As I drew near one of these buildings on Sunday, I
saw washed clothes hanging out. Saturday is the Sabbath
of these Baptists, and like the rest of the world it
appears that such begin their week with washing.</p>

<p>The little community at the time of my visit was
grievously exercised over a lawsuit among the members.
The matter had been referred to a master in chancery,
who thus speaks of them in his report: “At the time
of the commencement of the differences from which has
sprung the present controversy, and for some years previously,
the members of the society in regular attendance
at its meetings, and habitually observant of its religious
ordinances, were in number about thirty, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
not less than three-fourths appear to have been women.
They seem to be an uneducated or but slightly educated
people, in narrow circumstances as to property, the male
members being in general mechanics and laboring men,
resident in and about the village of Ephrata, in this
county, and a considerable proportion of all the members,
male as well as female, being dependent for subsistence
either wholly or partially upon the funds of the
society. They do not appear to have formulated specifically
articles of faith or rules of discipline, but profess
to take for their guidance simply the Bible and New
Testament, and the distinctive features of their practice
are, their observance of the seventh day of the week instead
of the first as the Sabbath; the administration of
the rite of baptism by trine immersion, with forward
action, in a stream of flowing water; and by the love-feasts
held annually at their communion, and lasting
from Friday evening until Sunday morning, at which
food is provided for all members, as well as all strangers
who may choose to attend the meeting; and by the washing
of each other’s feet by the members, previously to
the breaking of bread at the communion.... The
church at Ephrata, it should be mentioned, is one of four
branches, as they are called, of the society of [German?]
Seventh-Day Baptists. The other three being established,
respectively, at Snow Hill, Bedford, and Alleghany, in
this State.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BETHLEHEM_AND_THE_MORAVIANS">BETHLEHEM AND THE MORAVIANS.</h2>

</div>

<p>On August 22, 1873, as I stood upon the tower of
Packer Hall, Lehigh University, I saw spread out before
me the whole of Bethlehem, with furnaces, railroads,
bridges, churches, schools; and the rolling country and
cultivated fields of Northampton and Lehigh Counties.
Pointing to a wooded hill, my little guide said, “That is
Iron Hill, where iron ore comes from.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In the first house built at Bethlehem, on the 24th of
December, 1741, Zinzendorf and his companions celebrated
their first Christmas Eve in America. I saw in
the town a picture, by Grünewald, of the house in which
they met,—a long, one-story log house, with overhanging
eaves, the unbroken forest behind admirably expressing
the loneliness of the situation. In the beginning, one
end of this building was for cattle, as in Switzerland
and other parts of South Germany.</p>

<p>When this first house was newly erected, Zinzendorf
visited it, and on Christmas Eve he went with others
into the stable and sang,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nicht aus Jerusalem, sondern Bethlehem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aus dem kommt, was mir frommt.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or, in prose,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That which is profitable to me comes not from Jerusalem, but
from Bethlehem,”—</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and thus the new-born <i>town</i> was named Bethlehem.</p>

<p>“The material treasures of the Lehigh valley,” says
a Moravian bishop, “the national rage of hastening to
be rich, will, I fear, too much overgrow the spiritual
interests of the people.”</p>

<p>Since Zinzendorf entered the log cabin of Bethlehem
one hundred and thirty years have passed by, and four
or five generations of mortal men. Other changes too
have befallen the Moravians. For twenty years they
lived in an <i>economie</i>, or associated like one family. That
strict rule, which afterwards kept the unmarried in
brother- and sister-houses, has since been annulled, and
no vestige of it remains here but in the custom of sitting
in church, the brethren on one side, and the sisters on
the other. And this is not universal: families sit together.</p>

<p>In like manner has disappeared here the custom of
appealing to the lot, which formerly prevailed even in
matters so solemn as marriage.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The plainness of apparel which distinguished the
Moravians has disappeared also. Once even the young
ladies who studied at the boarding-school were obliged
to wear the peculiar Moravian dress.</p>

<p>In the Historical Collection at Nazareth are preserved
thick muslin caps, such as the women once wore, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
peculiar pieces, like a scallop shell, to cover the ears.
Those tasteful little caps now worn by the young
women in the choir, and the neat ones worn by the
sisters who serve at the love-feasts, can scarcely keep up
the memory of those of olden time.</p>

<p>Once the Moravians did not take oaths, but obeyed
literally the command, “Swear not at all;” but now
judicial oaths are permitted.</p>

<p>Formerly, the bulk of the real estate belonged to the
church, and none could buy who were not members;
but this rule has been broken, and <i>foreigners</i> have been
allowed to buy land in Bethlehem and other Moravian
towns.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>One trait, which has hitherto remarkably distinguished
them, still exists, namely, a great missionary
zeal. In 1873 a gentleman gave the numbers of the
Moravians at seventy thousand baptized missionary converts,
to twenty-three thousand home members in Europe
and America. On this estimate the missionary converts
are more than three to each of the members in the
other lands.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>At Bethlehem a considerable landed estate belongs to
the Church, whence is drawn an income of about eighteen
thousand dollars. All the institutions of learning here,
including the Young Ladies’ Boarding-School, belong
to the Church, and the teachers are its salaried officers.</p>

<p>The different provinces of the Church, the American,
English, and German, are like separate States of our
Union, their general head meeting or residing in Saxony.
This general synod still, in some respects, gives
rules to our Pennsylvania Moravians; and one of the
bishops says that the Moravian is the only Protestant
Church which is a unity throughout the world.</p>

<h3>FESTIVALS.</h3>

<p>My first visit to Bethlehem occurred at Whitsuntide,—Whitsunday
or Pentecost falling upon June 1. As
early as half-past seven there was music from the
steeple of the large Moravian church, from a choir of
trombone players. This instrument, which is of the
trumpet kind, is much in use among the Moravians
for church music,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the choir generally consisting of
four pieces.</p>

<p>In the morning I went to the large church, in which
English services are held. In this church there were no
pews, or rather, there were “open pews” without doors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
Soon after the opening of the services, passages of Scripture
were read alternately, a verse by the preacher, and
one by the congregation. Afterwards the Apostles’
Creed was repeated in concert. Also a litany was
read; for the Moravians, if in some things they resembled
Quakers, were very far from them in discarding
outward forms.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>There was in the morning no public extemporaneous
prayer, nor any prayer in the printed service, except the
litanies.</p>

<p>Notice was given that the anniversary of the Female
Missionary Society would be celebrated in the afternoon
by a love-feast, and that the Communion would be held
in the afternoon in the German language, and in the
evening in the English.</p>

<p>The love-feasts of the church, which are numerous,—fifteen
in the course of the year,—are religious meetings
accompanied by a simple refection of coffee, and rusks
or buns. They are founded, it seems, upon a passage in
Jude, and are intended to set forth by a simple meal, of
which all partake in common, that there is no respect
of persons before the Lord.</p>

<p>The religious services upon the present occasion consisted
of singing and prayer, and some remarks were
made by a gentleman who had formerly been a missionary
in Jamaica. In a calm manner, mothers were urged
to devote their children to the missionary service, rather
than to active business (worldly) employments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>The love-feast coffee is celebrated. As it was brought
in, diffusing its odor through the church, there was singing
in the German language. It was handed in white
mugs by one of the brethren, and the rusks, which were
light and good, were presented in a basket by a sister.</p>

<p>After the address was over, neatly dressed sisters, as
well as brethren, passed among the congregation and
collected the coffee mugs upon wooden trays.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p class="tb">In a manner similar to this just described, the Moravians
celebrate upon the 25th of June the anniversary
of the founding of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class="tb">The services on Easter morning are described in a
familiar manner by Mr. Grider, in his “Historical Notes
on Music in Bethlehem.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>About three in the morning the band of trombone
players begins to pass through the streets, to awaken the
members of the congregation. The spacious church is
usually filled at an early hour, and the Easter morning
litany, which embraces the creed of the Church, is repeated.
At the passage, “Glory unto him, who is the
resurrection and the life,” the minister announces that
the rest of the litany will be repeated on the burial-ground.
A procession is formed, and it is so timed that
as it enters the grounds it is met by the glorious beams
of the rising sun, an emblem of resurrection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The services are continued in the open air, the singing
being led by the instrumental performers. It is said
that on a fair morning “about two thousand persons
usually attend this really grand and impressive service;”
the grounds, which are always kept neat, being especially
attended to before Easter.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Their first service on
Easter Sunday took place at Herrnhut, Saxony, in the
year 1732. The “Young Men’s Class” repaired before
dawn to the graveyard, and spent an hour and a half in
singing and prayer.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The same manner of observing Easter seems to be
world-wide. From the Mission Report, we learn that
Brother A. Gericke, writing from Fredericksthal, Greenland,
says, “At Easter it was so beautifully mild that we
could read the Church litany, according to the custom at
home, in the burial-ground.”</p>

<p class="tb">The celebration of Christmas Eve is spoken of by
Mr. Grider, who says, “The services last about two
hours, during which the Rev. J. F. F. Hagen’s ‘Morning
Star, the darkness break!’ is sung alternately by the
choir in the gallery and the children in the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
church. This anthem,” he says, “although simple, and
intended for children only, has taken deep root in the
hearts of the congregation, who seem never to tire of its
performance.”</p>

<p>Other musical compositions are performed, such as,—</p>

<ul>
<li>“For unto us a child is born” (<i>Handel</i>).</li>
<li>“Sey willkommen” (Welcome) (<i>Haydn</i>).</li>
<li>“Lift up your heads, O ye gates!” (<i>Handel</i>).</li>
<li>“Gloria,” 12th Mass (<i>Mozart</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Mr. G. tells us that at this time the church choir
numbers sixteen female and eight male singers. The
accompaniment consists of the organ, two first and two
second violins, viola, violoncello, double bass, two French
horns, two trumpets, trombone, and flute. This is certainly
a remarkable variety of instruments in a church
choir.</p>

<p class="tb">A lady of Nazareth tells me that Christmas Eve is
celebrated among the Moravians by a love-feast in the
church. After the cakes and coffee, little wax-candles,
lighted, are brought in upon trays, and distributed to the
children, while verses are sung. “This,” says she, “is
to give them an impression of the Sun of Righteousness.”
The following lines were sung for several years
(and may still be in use):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Geh’ auf mit hellem Schein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Und leucht ins Herz hinein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leucht über Gross und Klein!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Du Sonne der Gerechtigkeit!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Verbreite Wonn’ und Seligkeit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Und flamme jedermann</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yetzt und fortan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Zu brünst’ger Liebe an.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of which I offer the following version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Rise with clear lustre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shine within the heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shine over great and small,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou Sun of Righteousness!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spread joy and blessedness!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kindle every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Henceforth as well as now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To warmest love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A lady of Bethlehem says that the Moravians there
follow the German fashion, not of having a Christmas-tree
merely, but a <i>Putz</i>, or decoration; in which they
usually represent a manger with cattle, the infant Jesus
and his mother, and the three wise men. At the young
ladies’ seminary she says that the <i>Putzes</i> are often very
fine. The people go around to see the decorations.
Christmas is a great festival.</p>

<p class="tb">The New Year is thus celebrated. At half-past
eleven, on New Year’s Eve, the congregation assemble
for “watch meeting.” I condense Mr. Grider’s description:
“After the officiating minister enters, the
choir sing Bishop Gregor’s solemn composition, ‘Lord,
Lord God,’ and then the congregation sing; after which
the text for that day is read from the Text-Book, and is
the subject of the discourse which follows. Meanwhile
the musicians in the choir watch the progress of the
night, and assemble before the organ; and the organist
sits with his feet poised, ready to begin. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
year expires, the new one is welcomed by a loud crash
of melody from the organ, and a double choir of trombone
players. The congregation rise and join in singing,
followed by prayer, etc.” These services are always
largely attended.</p>

<p>I have just spoken of the text for the day. A friend
says, “These texts for the day are published in a little
annual volume, ‘Doctrinal Texts of the Unitas Fratrum,’
prepared in Saxony and sent to the Moravians the
world over,—in Africa, Asia, Australia, and America.
The first text is selected by lot, the remainder by a committee
at Herrnhut. This is a relic of the old times,
when the Moravians used the lot in many religious
ceremonies,—even in marriage.”</p>

<p>Another says, “The Text-Book consists of a selection
of verses from the Bible, for each day, with appropriate
collects taken from the Hymn-Book. It has been
issued since 1731. The first verse, or ‘daily word,’ contains
a short sentence of prayer, exhortation, or promise.
The second, or ‘doctrinal text,’ is intended to enforce
some doctrinal truth or practical duty. The Text-Book
is printed in English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish,
Danish, Esquimaux, and in the Negro-English of Surinam,
S. A.”</p>

<p>Birthdays were formerly celebrated among the Moravians,
and still are in some families, as a citizen of Bethlehem
tells me, by little home parties, called <i>vespers</i>,
where the friends of the family are bidden between two
and three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and where they partake of coffee and
sugar-cake; a cake used not only among the Moravians
here, but by the people of Northern Germany. Birthdays
were formerly celebrated by serenades. Record<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
was also kept of the birthdays of friends, of distinguished
members of the church, etc.</p>

<p>The Birthday-Book and Text-Book, says Mr. Grider,
were placed on the breakfast-table each morning. After
the text was read, and while the family were being
served, the record was generally consulted to see whose
birthday it was. This custom served as a bond which
held the inhabitants in social union.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>When a death occurs in the Moravian congregation
at Bethlehem, the choir of trombonists plays several
tunes from the steeple of the large church. Any Moravian
can tell from the tunes played to which choir or
band the deceased belonged, whether to the married
men’s or married women’s, to the young men’s or young
women’s, to the children’s, or to any other of the bands
into which the congregation is divided,—divisions which
were formerly of more importance than now.</p>

<p>At funerals the same choir of trombones heads the
procession.</p>

<h3>THE GRAVEYARD.</h3>

<p>Walking in the street at Bethlehem, I saw a large,
shaded, and grassy enclosure with seats in it, and a number
of girls and children, children’s carriages, etc. I said
to a working man, “What do you call this,—a square?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>It was the graveyard or old burial-place, but there
were no monuments visible, from the Moravian custom
of laying stones, called breast-stones, flat upon spots
of interment.</p>

<p>If you enter this yard from the northwest corner, from
Market Street, you come immediately upon the graves
of three bishops, in no way more conspicuous than the
others which bear breast-stones. One says, “Johannes
Etwein, Episcopus Fratrum (or Bishop of the Brethren);
born June 29th, 1721, at Freudenstadt in Germany, departed
Jan. 2d, 1802.</p>

<p class="center">“Here he rests in peace.”</p>

<p>The graves of the Indians and negroes, who were
buried here, are not in an especial corner or division,
but are indiscriminately mingled with those of the other
Moravians. But on the outer edge are buried some
persons of disreputable life.</p>

<p>One stone bears the following inscription:</p>

<p>“In memory of Tschoop, a Mohican Indian, who in
holy baptism, Ap. 16, 1742, received the name of John:
one of the first fruits of the mission at Shekomeko, N.Y.,
and a remarkable instance of the power of Divine Grace,
whereby he became a distinguished teacher among his
nation. He departed this life in full assurance of faith
at Bethlehem, Aug. 27, 1746.</p>

<p>“There shall be one fold, and one Shepherd.—John
x. 6.”</p>

<p>About sixty-two Indians are buried here. A daughter
of Heckewelder (the distinguished missionary) furnished
new gravestones for some of these Indian remains.</p>

<p>The largest stone in the enclosure rests upon the grave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of one of mixed blood, not a Moravian, and I may be
allowed to give a portion of the inscription as it is:</p>

<p>“In Memory to my dearest Son, James McDonald
Ross, eldest son of John Ross, principal Chief of the
Cherokee Nation ... died in St. Louis, Nov. 9th, 1864.
His Corps transported by Adams Express to Bethlehem,
and interred at this sacred spot Nov. 22d, 1864, aged 50
years 29 days.”</p>

<p>One of the stones bears the name Traugott Leinbach,
which may be translated Trust-God Flaxbrook, but
which does not seem peculiar to those familiar with it.</p>

<p>At some of the graves there were bright, freshly-cut
flowers.</p>

<p>At Nazareth I visited an enclosure which had once
been a graveyard, but which had been neglected, and the
stones in it had been moved by one who had become
owner. This neglect has lately been atoned for by erecting
a monument inscribed with the names of those
buried here. The list was obtained by consulting the
full and accurate accounts, which it is the duty of all
Moravian ministers to keep. In looking at the names
on the monument, I observed one Beata, an Indian, who
died in 1746, and two others, Beatus Schultz and Beata
Böhmer. These were names assigned to infants dead
before christening; Beatus, Beata, meaning Blessed.</p>

<h3>OLD RECOLLECTIONS.</h3>

<p>I met, at Bethlehem, a member of the Moravian Historical
Society, who was born in that town in 1796, and
was educated there. He was taught German, and could
scarcely speak English at all at eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>He learned his trade as clock- and watch-maker in the
brethren’s house. He was also employed until lately as
teacher of vocal music in the parochial school.</p>

<p>When he was in the brethren’s house—he began to
learn his trade in 1810—there were about twenty brethren
domiciled there,—though some of these had their
shops elsewhere. They were all mechanics; there being
a baker, shoemaker, tinsmith, etc. The cook was also
an unmarried brother, all these household services being
performed by the brethren themselves. My informant
(he was the youngest boy) had to prepare breakfast for
his employer.</p>

<p>When the morning bell sounded aloud (<i>Morgen
Glocke zum Aufstehen</i>) the boys sprang up, and when one
story down, went into the prayer-hall, where the <i>vorsteher</i>
or superintendent directed the services; first they
“sang a verse,” and then the <i>vorsteher</i> read the text for
the day. When the boys got down to the lower floor
(the four boys who then lodged in the building), they
swept out the rooms that were used for shops, ground
their coffee, ran down to the cook in the cellar-kitchen
and set their pots upon the coals, preparing a simple
breakfast of bread, butter, and coffee, of which each boy
partook with his employer in the shop. Then they made
their cot-beds or threw the blankets back upon them;
the brethren made their own.</p>

<p>Mr. W.’s mother did not admire her son’s manner of
performing these domestic services. When she came
down to bring fresh bedclothes and to look after matters,
she said, “If I had wax, I’d take a mould of your
body here from your bed.” “Why, what a crust you
have inside of your coffee-pot!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Breakfast, in Mr. W.’s time, was thus eaten separately,
but before that, when all the property was in
common, “<i>eine economische Haushaltung</i>,” or economical
household,—“every one was poor in that early day,”—all
the meals were eaten at a common table.</p>

<p class="tb">After breakfast, the boys washed the dishes and went
to their work.</p>

<p>At a quarter before twelve the chapel bell rang for
dinner, a custom which continued until about 1870.
“I missed it,” said Mr. W., “when it stopped, for I
had heard it all my life.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>I inquired of Mr. W. whether they kept their time a
half-hour or more ahead, like other Pennsylvania Germans.
He replied that one of the brethren kept his
clock by the sun-dial.</p>

<p>Mr. W. did not dine or sup at the brother-house, but
went home for these meals. At the age of twelve, according
to the usual custom, he left the children’s choir,
and became a member of the great boys’ choir. The
little boys and girls held their festivals together.</p>

<p>At eighteen he joined the young men’s choir. About
this time the brethren’s house was given up to the female
seminary or boarding-school, and the few remaining
brethren scattered through the town.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>There had been little or no intercourse between these
unmarried brethren and the sisters, but some staid, elderly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
sister was appointed to visit the brother-house and
see whether all the surroundings were clean.</p>

<p class="tb">“I remember,” Mr. ⸺ said, “when marriages were
made by lot, but that drove off a great many of the young
people. The marriage by lot was more suited to missionaries
who had not time for a two years’ courtship.
Dr. Franklin, when in Bethlehem, asked Bishop Spangenberg
whether this practice did not make unhappy
marriages, but the bishop replied, ‘Are all marriages
happy that are made after long courtship?’ We did
not have divorces, anyhow,” said Mr. W.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>This was the manner of the marriage by lot.</p>

<p>If a young missionary came home, and met his friends,
they would say, “Well, you’ve come home to get married?”</p>

<p>He would answer, “Yes; do you know of any one
suitable?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there’s Sister Gretchen” (or Peggy).</p>

<p>Another might say, “There’s Sister Liddy;” and thus
a half-dozen names would perhaps be gathered. He had
the privilege of arranging the order of this list himself.
Then, after prayer, the elders drew lots, taking the first
name; one ballot being <i>Ja</i> and the other <i>Nein</i> (Yes and
No).</p>

<p>The idea was of an especial Providence, by which he
should find out whether it was the Lord’s will that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
should have the first. If the first lot should prove <i>Ja</i>,
the result was communicated to the sister, and time was
allowed her to reflect whether to accept or refuse.</p>

<p>In the course of our conversation, Mr. W. rose and
went into the next room; and, returning, brought two
vest-buttons of crystal, set in silver, of which he gave
the following account:</p>

<p>“My grandfather was a clothmaker, at Basle, in Switzerland.
Zinzendorf being there<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> called upon the young
man, who was about leaving for America, to join the
Bethlehem and Nazareth settlements.</p>

<p>“Zinzendorf said to him, ‘Matthias, we won’t meet
any more in this world, but hope to meet in a better.’
He put his hand into his vest-pocket, and said, ‘I’m
sorry I have nothing to leave you to remember me by.’</p>

<p>“Young Matthias answered, striking his breast, ‘As
long as this heart shall beat, I’ll not forget you.’</p>

<p>“With a glance, Zinzendorf seized the shears from
the clothmaker’s table, and quickly cut off two of his
vest-buttons. ‘Take these,’ he said, ‘they’re nearest
the heart.’”</p>

<p>It was the grandson of the clothmaker, himself a
great-grandfather, who narrated the story, which he had
received traditionally.</p>

<p>“I think,” said he, “that this exhibits the quickness
of thought of Count Zinzendorf. He was a great recruiting
sergeant. On meeting a young man whom he
took a fancy to, he would say, ‘I have a place for you;
I want you to go to Greenland, or (perhaps) to the Cape<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
of Good Hope.’ The young man, astonished, would
wonder what this conspicuous nobleman meant by this.
He generally succeeded, however, in charming the young
man, and the matter ended by his going upon the mission.”</p>

<p class="tb">A few recollections of old times were also given to
me by a citizen of Nazareth, aged eighty-two, whom I
call Mr. P. He himself was born in Bethlehem, but
his father in Connecticut; his grandfather having migrated
and bought a farm at Gnadenhütten, a Moravian
settlement, near Mauch Chunk.</p>

<p>Mr. P.’s mother was a Miksch. She was placed at
the age of four years at the building at Nazareth, called
Ephrata, to enable her mother to work.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> She did not
like the treatment that she received here. “Her mother
worked in the house (her house), and in the field, I
think,” said Mr. P. “The women now do not work
much in the fields,” he added. “They’re afraid they
might spoil their fingers. They’re brought up altogether
too proud. I don’t know what will become of the next
generation.</p>

<p>“My father moved to Bethlehem, and worked at his
carpenter’s trade. When he was married he went to the
ferry (at Bethlehem), and kept it for ten years. There
were no bridges then. He saw hard times in cold
weather and high water. After that he moved to the
saw-mill and distillery, which belonged to the Moravian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
Society. I think he got all he made in the distillery,
but worked for wages in the saw-mill.”</p>

<p>“The Moravians distilled liquor, then?” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes; they commonly drinked a little too, about nine
o’clock.</p>

<p>“When I was between thirteen and fourteen, I went
to my trade. I was put into the brothers’ house to sleep.
My trade was a blacksmith’s, and a pretty hard one too.
I served my trade seven years and seven months. When
I was in the brother-house, I spent my evenings and
Sundays there. I had liberty to go home to my parents,
but not to be running, like they do nowadays, and do
mischief.</p>

<p>“My wife was not a member of the church,—we were
married fifty-five years ago. Brother Seidel, the Moravian
preacher, married us. They were not so strict
then as they had been, in turning all those out of meeting
that married out.”</p>

<p>Mr. P. has a strong German accent. He said, “I
never talked much English, only when I lived nine
years and a half at Quakertown. I now speak German
altogether in my family. The young people here now
all try to speak English. They’re throwing the German
away too much.”</p>

<p class="tb">At Nazareth, in 1874, I met Mr. M., eighty-six years
old, who said that he was married in 1812. “I
thought,” said he, “that my wife and I were the last
couple married by lot; but I have heard that there was
one since.”</p>

<p>Mr. M. said that the young men and women had
some opportunity to see each other, for although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
young men were not allowed to visit the young women
at their own houses, yet they would sometimes meet in
visiting; but they were not allowed to speak to each
other more than “a couple of times.”</p>

<p>Mr. M. and I did not agree in sentiment with a
Moravian woman who had told me that young men and
young women were not allowed to keep company, and
<i>they did not think about it</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes there would be young persons attached to
each other for a couple of years, and the lot being unfavorable,
they would go away and leave the congregation.
“Well, it was a pretty hard thing,” said the old
man, “for a pair of young people who loved each other
dearly to have the lot go against them.” He continued
nearly thus: “There was one of the boys who was with
me in the brother-house who, I think, left the congregation
to be married to a member. It was generally the
case, then, that after a couple of years they would ask
pardon, and be taken back. We used to say, ‘You’ll
have to take your hat under your arm and ask pardon.’”</p>

<p>Mr. M. told me, concerning the Moravians formerly,
that the <i>verlobung</i>, or betrothal, lasted sometimes only
about a week. “When I was married we had a kind of
love-feast after the marriage. Some were picked out to
stay, and we had wine or coffee and cake in the church.
That was the old custom.”</p>

<p>I suggested to Mr. M. that as there were meetings
held every evening the young people could see each other
there. “There were meetings nearly every evening,”
he answered. “I remember when I worked at my trade
breaking off work and going to church. We went in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
our every-day clothes, just putting on our coats. Most
every evening it was, when I was young. My trade
was a blacksmith, and I was seven years an apprentice
with my father. He was a pretty strict master, and I
had to get up, winter or summer, at five o’clock, and
now I wake at that hour although eighty-six.”</p>

<p class="tb">Recollections of a people would be imperfect without
those of the women.</p>

<p>I saw at Nazareth Mrs. B., who was born at the
Moravian town of Litiz, in Lancaster County, and who
was in her eightieth year.</p>

<p>“When I was a child,” said she, “we had Christmas
dialogues, about the birth of Christ, his sufferings and
death, which were repeated by the children. The dialogues
were in the school on Christmas-day, but were
repeated several times, so that all might hear, and we
never got tired of it.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Christmas-trees were put up
then, as they are now. The Christmas <i>Putzes</i> or decorations
were left standing until after New Year.</p>

<p>“On Easter morning we meet in the church at five in
the morning, and the first tune they sing is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Der Herr ist aufershtanden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Er ist wahrhaftig aufershtanden,’<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The Lord has arisen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has indeed arisen.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“At a certain place where the litany speaks of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
who are buried in the churchyard, and of their rising
again, we walk out into the churchyard, and the trombone
players accompany the hymns that are sung. If
the weather is stormy that we cannot go out, this is
always a disappointment.</p>

<p>“When I was young, if a child was born in the
morning, it was taken to church in the evening to be
christened. Religious meetings were held every evening;
sometimes a prayer-meeting, sometimes a <i>sing-meeting</i>.</p>

<p>“I recollect marriages by lot very well, because they
continued until about 1818. All marriages were by lot.
Young men and young women were not allowed to keep
company, and they did not think about it.”</p>

<p>“They hardly dared to look at each other,” said
another person present.</p>

<p>Mrs. B. continued: “If a young man wanted to
marry,—of course he had his eye on some one he would
like,—he told it to the <i>Brüder-Pfleger</i> (Caretaker of the
Brothers), who told it to the minister, and the minister
to the <i>Schwester-Pfleger</i> (Caretaker of the Sisters). The
name that the young man chose was taken into the lot,
and if the lot was favorable he might proceed, but if
not he must look out for another. If the lot was favorable
it was told to the young woman by the <i>Schwester-Pfleger</i>,
and if the young woman was willing this sister
told the minister. There was a <i>Brüder-Pfleger</i> in each
brother-house, and a <i>Schwester-Pfleger</i> in each sister-house.</p>

<p>“Betrothals took place after the young woman had
given her consent, in the presence of the conference,
composed of the ministers and their wives, and the marriage
would generally take place within a week, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
church. The wedding was public, but those who were
invited stayed to the <i>Schmaus</i> (feast),<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which was cake
and wine in the church. Thus the ceremony was completed.</p>

<p>“Moravians then dressed with great plainness, much
like the Quakers.”</p>

<p>As the Moravians were so very strict about the intercourse
of the sexes, they could not have allowed two
young men and two young women to sit up together
with the unburied dead, as has been the custom among
some of our Pennsylvania people.</p>

<p>I spoke upon this point to Mrs. B., who said, “Women
always sat up with women, and men with men. However,
in old times, as soon as there was a death, the trombones
sounded, as they do now, and the body was taken
when dressed, immediately to a small stone building
called the corpse-house, and here remained until the
funeral.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. ⸺ said that she lost her parents before she
was three years old, and was taken into the sister-house,
and her brothers into the brother-house. Even those
who had parents living sometimes preferred to live in
these buildings.</p>

<p class="tb">Some simple details of home-life were given to me by
Mrs. C., of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>In their own family, in her youth, they rose about five,
and breakfasted at six, usually on bread, butter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
coffee, perhaps with the addition of molasses. At nine
they had a lunch of cold meat, pie, and bread and butter;
and at a quarter before twelve came the dinner of meat
and vegetables. Often they had soup. There was soup
every day at the sister-house, and I was told that in cases
of sickness it could be bought there.</p>

<p>“We always had pie for dinner. At two we had
coffee and bread and butter. This was called vesper.
At six was our supper of cold meat, bread and butter,
and pickles. We always had pickles, and every day in
the year we had apple-butter.”</p>

<p>Mrs. C.’s father was a miller, and perhaps lived more
“full and plenty” than some of his neighbors.</p>

<p>She continued: “Every Saturday, we baked bread,
pies, and sugar-cake. We made a great many doughnuts,
or <i>Fast-nacht gucke</i>.” (Shrove-Tuesday pancakes,
as we may say.) “We made crullers, and called them
<i>Schtrumpf-bänder</i>” (“garters,” doubtless from their form).
“Nearly all our cakes were made from raised dough.
One we called <i>Bäbe</i>. ‘Snow-balls’ were made with
plenty of eggs, milk, flour, and a little sugar, and were
fried in fat.</p>

<p>“At Christmas we always had turkeys; and then we
baked a great supply of cakes, from four quarts of
molasses and four pounds of sugar, and these lasted all
winter. Then every evening before we went to bed we
had Christmas cakes, sweet cider, and apples.</p>

<p>“The two o’clock vesper has generally fallen out of
use, but if any one comes to town now that I want to
invite, and it is not convenient to have them to dinner
or supper, I say, ‘Come to vesper.’ Then we have coffee,
and always sugar-cake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“It would not be a vesper without the sugar-cake,”
said Mrs. C.’s daughter.</p>

<p>For a vesper-party for guests, Mrs. C. sets a table,
and adds smoked beef, preserves, or anything that she
chooses.</p>

<p>She further told me that her parents were married by
lot, and lived very happily, and she added that as far as
we hear, and have seen, most of the pairs thus married
lived happily. But the young people were dissatisfied
with these marriages. Although the young man had the
privilege of putting in the names of several whom he
would like, yet if none of these were drawn he became
discontented.</p>

<p>“Should a name be chosen that did not please the
young man, I believe he had liberty to withdraw.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>“In those times of strict rule, there was no opportunity
for the young people of both sexes to become acquainted.
This rule originated at Herrnhut. It was on account
of it that an unmarried brother who worked in our mill
was not allowed to sleep in our house, but must go every
night to the brother-house to lodge until the rule was
given up, about sixty years ago, and the brother was
then allowed to sleep in the mill.”</p>

<p>While Mrs. C. was talking, her husband remarked
that if he could find a town such as Bethlehem was in
1822 (when, if I remember aright, he had come to the
place a stranger), he would go thousands of miles to get
his family there to live. The whole town, he said, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
composed of Moravians, and was like one family, living
well, all in comfort, plain in their dress, happy and contented
with their lot.</p>

<h3>OLD BUILDINGS.</h3>

<p>The sister-house, the <i>Gemein-haus</i>, and the widow-house
are still standing at Bethlehem, solid stone buildings
with great roofs and dormer-windows. One of
them has immense stone buttresses, and all are fitted to
withstand the effects of time. Their appearance, indeed,
is becoming peculiar. The brother-house is still standing,
but has disappeared from view as a separate structure,
having been incorporated, as I have mentioned, in
the young ladies’ seminary.</p>

<p>The sister-house is owned by the Board of Elders
of the Northern Diocese of the Church of the United
Brethren (Unitas Fratrum) in the United States, and
apartments are furnished to the widows and daughters
of servants of the church, rent free. Any unmarried
Moravian woman (or widow) may also have rooms here,
but not free of charge.</p>

<p>The corner-stone of the widow-house was laid in
1767. This conspicuous building has recently been purchased
by a friend of the church. The apartments will
be appropriated free of rent to the widows and unmarried
daughters of missionaries, ministers, and other
servants of the church, including teachers in the seminaries.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>The <i>Gemein-haus</i> (congregation-house) was used for
the ministers’ families, sometimes three or four, who resided
in Bethlehem. It is no longer occupied by these,
but by other members of the society. It adjoins the
old chapel, where the preaching is in German. These
old buildings, especially the widow-house, are in good
repair.</p>

<p>One of the most striking circumstances connected with
some of the old buildings at Nazareth is the account
of the numbers of persons whom they are said to have
once sheltered. The sister-house is a large structure,
but the brother-house is so inconspicuous upon the street
of the quiet little town, being, indeed, occupied as a
store and dwelling, and probably sheltering not more
than two families, that it is quite wonderful to hear tell
of fifty persons having once had their homes in it.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Of one of the most noteworthy buildings at Nazareth
I have already made mention. It was called Ephrata.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
The foundations were laid by Whitefield, the celebrated
preacher, who bought five thousand acres in the forks
of the Delaware, or where the Lehigh empties into that
stream. This tract was afterwards bought by the Moravians.
In 1744, thirty-three married couples from
Bethlehem moved into this house.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In 1749, the
“nursery,” of which I have before spoken, was removed
here from Bethlehem. Recently this old building<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
has been completely renovated, and the upper floor
contains the collection and library of the Moravian
Historical Society. The building is called the Whitefield-house,
but it might still be called Ephrata, or a
place of rest, for the lower part is a dwelling for retired
missionary families. Only one family was there at the
time of my visit, a widow with children. Little people
were running about and laughing below, quite at home.</p>

<p>The “sustentation fund” of the Moravian Church
supports the “resting ministers” (such as the Methodists
call superannuated ministers) the widows and children
of missionaries, etc.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS.</h3>

<p>An acquaintance said to me in Lancaster, “The
people of Bethlehem are not Pennsylvania Dutch. They
speak the high German.” I think, however, that the
younger people have acquired the Pennsylvania dialect.
An elderly gentleman of Bethlehem, to whom mention
was made of a work upon the “Pennsylvania Dutch,”
etc., replied in this manner (with a German accent):
“We don’t want to know anything about the Pennsylvania
Dutch. We know enough about them already.
We see enough of them on our farms.”</p>

<p>It may be inferred from what has been said that the
Moravians are persons of very considerable culture. I
may go further, and speak of the thoughtful, spiritual
expression of many faces.</p>

<p>As agriculture may be called the vocation of the
Pennsylvania Germans in general, so education may be
called the vocation of the Moravians. To the support
of the parochial school at Bethlehem I heard that about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
nine thousand dollars are annually appropriated from
the income of the church property there. This enables
those who have charge to put the terms of instruction
very low. These are four dollars, or four to six, annually,
for Moravian children.</p>

<p>The daughters of Moravian preachers are entitled to
four years’ tuition in one of the young ladies’ schools,
either at the celebrated one at Bethlehem, that at Litiz,
Pennsylvania, at Salem, North Carolina, or at Hope,
Indiana.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Besides these institutions, there is a flourishing
boys’ school at Nazareth, and a college and divinity
school at Bethlehem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very few of the Moravians here are engaged in agriculture.
They have remained in towns, as it seems, and
rarely or never become large and wealthy farmers; a
circumstance that I do not comprehend. That religious
scruples against the acquisition of wealth, or of individual
property, have influenced their actions, I have
not been able to discover.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have not in my reports of aged citizens repeated
some of the “orthodox” expressions which they used.</p>

<p>“The distinguishing feature of Moravian theology,”
says Appleton’s Cyclopædia, “is the prominence given
to the person and atonement of Christ.”</p>

<p>I noticed at Bethlehem a sweet simplicity in speaking
to or of the preachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>A young man told me that Brother W. had sent him,
and one of the sisters unaffectedly addressed a venerable
bishop as Brother S. One of these gentlemen said to a
person, not a member of his church, “Call me brother.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have never heard Moravians call themselves Herrnhutters.
The favorite name of their churchmen for
their organization is Unitas Fratrum, or Unity of
Brethren. A venerable preacher tells me that they have
been called the <i>Johannische Gemein</i>, or community like
St. John; or their view the <i>Johannische Auffassung</i>, or
John-like expression, of the spirit of the gospel, especially
as we read in the seventeenth chapter of John the
prayer of Christ, “That they, Father, may be one, as
we are one.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I conclude this sketch with an abridged passage from
the Mission Report of 1872, an extract which may be
interesting to thoughtful minds:</p>

<p>“The celebration of the centenary of the Labrador
mission took place at all the six stations on the 5th and
6th of January, 1871. Some of the people assisted in
decorating the chapels by fetching fir-tree branches and
making festoons. A number of welcome jubilee presents
from the Ladies’ Association in London, and other
sisters, were distributed, and the services closed with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
celebration of the Lord’s Supper; a love-feast, at which
printed odes were used; and a thanksgiving service.
The brethren of Okak remark, ‘Stillness, not unusually
a feature of festive seasons in Labrador, prevailed in a
striking degree, and was to our minds more valuable as
a proof of spiritual blessings enjoyed than the finest
words could have been, especially as the Esquimaux
have great readiness in using religious phrases.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.—Christianity was introduced into Bohemia and Moravia
in the ninth century. It is claimed that the people of these countries,
for several centuries, manifested in matters of faith the spirit
of what was afterwards Protestantism. The most celebrated of
their reformers was John Huss, who was burned, by order of the
Council of Constance, in 1415. The Hussites separated into two
parties, of whom the Taborites were defeated by the Calixtines in
1434, and the latter became the national church of Bohemia. A
party among the remnant of the Taborites, dissatisfied with what
they thought corrupt practices in this church, removed more and
more from the Calixtine communion, and at length were permitted
to settle on the barony of Lititz. It is claimed that some, if not all,
of these were men of God, who had not taken up arms during the
war. They afterwards adopted the name <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>, or <i>Unity
of the Brethren</i>. Their pastors were Calixtine priests who had
joined the society. Such was the beginning of the Moravian
Church. They obtained the episcopal succession from a colony
of Waldenses, on the confines of Bohemia and Austria. Toward
the year 1500 they had more than two hundred churches in Moravia
and Bohemia, and had published a Bohemian Bible and
several confessions of faith.</p>

<p>Their numbers and influence increased very much, and gradually
the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i> was composed of three provinces, the Bohemian,
Moravian, and Polish. But, in 1621, Ferdinand II. began
a series of persecutions of all the Protestant denominations in
Bohemia and Moravia, known as the anti-reformation. Protestantism
was totally overthrown here, more than fifty thousand of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the inhabitants having emigrated. In Poland, the Brethren’s
Church became united with the Reformed, and the <i>Unitas Fratrum</i>
disappeared from the eyes of men, and remained as a “hidden seed”
for ninety-four years. In Moravia many families remained, who
secretly entertained the views of their fathers, and among these an
awakening took place in the early part of the eighteenth century,
through the instrumentality of a Moravian exile named Christian
David. The desire to live in a Protestant country was felt more
and more, and two families escaped in the night, and after eleven
days safely reached Berthelsdorf, an estate in Saxony belonging
to Count Zinzendorf, a pious young nobleman, who had offered
them a refuge. Other Moravians joined them, and in a few years
a colony of three hundred persons lived on Count Zinzendorf’s
estate. He himself soon relinquished all worldly honors, became
a bishop of the brethren, and devoted himself entirely to their
service.</p>

<p class="tb">Nicolaus Ludwig, Count of Zinzendorf and Pottendorf, descended
from a noble Austrian family, was born in Dresden in
1700. His father dying soon after his birth, his education was
confided to his grandmother, the Baroness de Gersdorf, who had
adopted the idea of Spener, the founder of the Pietists, of <i>little
churches within the church</i>, having for their aim the promotion
of piety and the purifying and sanctifying of the whole church.</p>

<p>The mind of Zinzendorf, when he was a mere child, took an enthusiastic
direction, and he used to write letters to the Saviour and
throw them out of the window, hoping that the Saviour might
find them. At the university of Wittenberg, he applied himself,
without direction or aid, to the study of theology, fully resolved
to become a minister of the gospel. In 1722 he married, and about
the same time gave some emigrant Moravian brethren permission
to settle upon his estate of Berthelsdorf. In connection with some
others, he labored to instruct them and their children. But it
would seem, from subsequent circumstances, that he himself became,
in some degree, their pupil.</p>

<p>They were not all agreed in religious opinions, and, with a view
to unity, he formed statutes for their government. He was also
appointed a warden of the congregation. In 1734 he went, under
an assumed name, to Stralsund, and passed an examination as a
theological candidate. The same year he received holy orders at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Tübingen. On returning from Switzerland, in 1736, he met an
edict forbidding his return to his native country, and repaired to
Berlin, where, under sanction of the King of Prussia, he was consecrated
bishop of the Moravian congregation, and from that time
was always called the Ordinary of the Brethren. The order of
banishment was repealed after eleven years.</p>

<p>Within this period he visited the islands of St. Thomas and St.
Croix, where the Brethren had already established missions. He
also came to Pennsylvania in 1741. He remained in this country
two years, during which he was very diligently and successfully
occupied. He also made several visits to Holland and England.
He spent his latter years at Herrnhut, where he died. His remains
were borne to the grave by thirty-two preachers and missionaries
whom he had reared, from Holland, England, Ireland, and North
America, including Greenland. He wrote more than one hundred
books. His son, who was an elder of the single brethren, died before
his father. His son-in-law, the Baron de Watteville, was a
bishop of the Moravian Church.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe the Moravian system of the time of
Zinzendorf is kept up in every respect. The governing board for
the whole “Unity,” or whole Moravian Church, meets at Berthelsdorf,
in Saxony, in the castle once inhabited by Count Zinzendorf,
who devoted his entire property to the good of the church.</p>

<p>A community of goods never existed at any time in a Moravian
institution. The <i>Economie</i>, or <i>Economische Haushaltung</i> (Economical
Household, or Common Housekeeping), seems to have
existed for about twenty years, during the Indian wars, when the
settlements of the Brethren at Bethlehem, etc., were feeble and
exposed to attack.</p>

<p>The numerical force of the Moravians is not great. The number
of communicants—home-communicants, if I may call them
so—is 12,947 (estimate of 1859?), and over 53,000 mission converts,
including baptized children. There are also, as I understand,
80,000 “Diaspora members” on the continent of Europe; for
which remarkable movement see the article <i>Moravians</i>, in Appleton’s
Cyclopædia. See, also, the <i>Moravian Manual</i>. This historical
sketch is drawn principally from these sources, and from the
articles <i>Zinzendorf</i> and <i>German Theology</i> of the same Cyclopædia.</p>

</div>

<p>I had before seen the Schwenkfelders mentioned as a
people who, like the Mennonites, Quakers, etc., are opposed
to war, but I never became personally acquainted
with them until the spring of 1873. At that time, a
gentleman of West Chester advised me to inform myself
concerning them, speaking of them as a delightful people.
On arriving at Norristown, I therefore made inquiry
about them from citizens of that borough, and was
kindly furnished with several letters of introduction to
members of the Schwenkfelder community living about
seven miles north of the town.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>It was about noon when the stage left me at the house
of one who had formerly been a preacher in the society.
Here I dined, conversed with my host about his people,
and looked at various large old volumes which he
showed to me. Then, having been supplied with an
escort, I went to a house in the same neighborhood, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
dwelling of an elderly brother, who had learned my
errand, and had expressed a wish to meet me.</p>

<p>Under his hospitable care, I remained until Sunday
evening; he taking me to the meeting-house and other
places. Through him I also received a present of several
books, giving the history and doctrines of the society.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening he took me to the house of another
member, whose kindly care did not cease until he had
conveyed me—on Monday morning—again to the
borough of Norristown.</p>

<h3>MEETING-HOUSE AND GRAVEYARD.</h3>

<p>The church which I visited is in Towamensing Township,
Montgomery County, and is one of six in Eastern
Pennsylvania which hold all the Schwenkfelders now
living. I was surprised to find the church in neat order
and in good preservation, thus indicating no lack of
vitality in this small religious body, which, like a transplanted
tree, has thrown out so few roots into adjoining
soil. The plain meeting-house stood upon the edge of a
wood; the graveyard was neat, and was enlivened by the
blossoms of the mountain pink,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and the bright sunshine
and tender green of May animated the scene.</p>

<p>Among the monumental stones was a rough one bearing
this inscription only: “A. R. W. 1745.” And this
was, I believe, the oldest here. Of nine years’ later date
was a gravestone, still unhewn and irregular in shape,
but with a longer inscription: “Psal. 90 v. 7. Baltzer
Anders, Gestorben 1754, 56.” The passage cited from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
the Psalms is the text of the funeral sermon. The rest
we may translate: “Balthazar Anders. Died 1754, at
the age of 56.”</p>

<p>At the date 1762 we find a carved marble head-stone,
but no showy monuments have been erected here. One
of the more modern stones says, “Rosina Kribelin, geb.
Hübnerin, alt 27 Yahr 5 monat,”—or “Rosina Kribel,
born Hübner, aged twenty-seven years and five months;”
the feminine termination in being added to both the
names.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Inscriptions older than these may be found at the
meeting-house in Lower Salford Township, and one of
them goes to a somewhat greater length in honor of him
for whom it was erected. Translated it reads thus: “In
memory of George Weiss, was born in Silesia, and first
teacher of the Schwenkfelder community in Pennsylvania;
died the 11th of March 1740, 53 years old.”</p>

<p>(The word teacher means preacher.)</p>

<p class="tb">Within the meeting-house there were enclosed benches
or open pews; the pulpit and the ends of these benches
upon the aisle being painted white. The men sat upon
one side of the house, the women upon the other; the
women removing their bonnets and wearing caps. These
caps were not severely plain, like those of the Mennonites,
etc., but were trimmed with white satin ribbon.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>The Schwenkfelder women bent the knee at the
name of Jesus, but this observance has fallen into
disuse among the men.</p>

<p>Before the morning service there is school, in
which the children are taught from the Catechism
and Testament; the Catechism containing the Apostles’
Creed. On Sunday afternoon, a school is held
in which the children are taught to read the German
language, in which tongue the church exercises are
conducted.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The Schwenkfelders claim to have been
among the earliest to establish Sabbath-schools, but
their school is of later date than that of Ludwig
Hoecker.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>During service, the pulpit or desk was occupied by
three preachers. The oldest had a fine countenance,
forehead, and coronal region of the head. The youngest,
a very solid-looking, fair-haired man, read a
portion of Scripture, and <i>read</i> a prayer.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Singing
accompanied these exercises, and then a few extemporaneous
remarks were made by the youngest preacher;
the open Bible lying before him, upon which his eyes
were cast. The oldest preacher spoke at length, and
was followed by the third, who wore a heavy black
beard.</p>

<p>The ministers of the Schwenkfelders, like those of
our similar sects, are unsalaried and without special
theological training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<h3>BOOKS.</h3>

<p>I have mentioned that he whom I first visited brought
out a number of large books for me to examine. They
were all in the German language.</p>

<p>The first bore title, “The first part of the Christian,
orthodox book, of the man noble, dear, and highly
favored by God, Caspar Schwenckfeldt.” The volume
was a folio; the place of printing not given; the date
1564. It is embellished by a large plate, which apparently
represents Christ with Death and Satan under his
feet. Below, upon the left, is a man in a furred robe
kneeling, with the motto, “Caspar Schwenckfeldt von
Ossing. Nil Christo triste recepto” (or, “If I have
Christ, nothing makes me sad”). On the right is a troop
of similar appearance, with the motto, “And the fellow-believers
of the glories and truth of Jesus Christ.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Another ancient folio, bound in parchment, with
brazen clasps, tips, and bosses, was said to be a volume
of Schwenkfeld’s letters. There is no place of printing;
the date is 1570. The same plate as the preceding.
These epistles, says my host, are upon the popish doctrine
and faith.</p>

<p>The third folio was of the same date, 1570, and was
in a splendid state of preservation. This contains letters
upon the Lutheran doctrine, with which Schwenkfeld
did not agree.</p>

<p>Two of the folios brought out by my host were manuscripts,
bound in leather, with brazen clasps. One of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
them had the great number of thirteen hundred and
three pages, very neatly written in the German hand.
It contained the sermons, “<i>Postilla</i>,” of Michael Hiller,
preacher at Zobten, in Silesia, who “disappeared in God”
in 1554; written and collected by Nicholas Detschke,
1564, and now written anew, 1747. I did not find the
name of the copyist.</p>

<p>Although my host told me he that he had never been
in Quaker meeting in his life, yet I found among his
books a history of the rise, etc., of the Christian people
called Quakers, originally written in Dutch by William
Sewel, and by himself translated into English, from
English translated into German (<i>Hochdeutsch</i>), 1742.
This is Sewel’s History, one of the most celebrated of
the Quaker books.</p>

<p>At the second house which I visited there lay in the
window-seat several books in German. One was a large
copy of the Scriptures, a clasped volume, with many
plates. Lying loose in it were two plates of Caspar
Schwenkfeld, in his furred robe, with beard descending
upon his breast, and his motto (already given) in German:
“<i>Wenn ich Christum habe, so bin ich nicht traurig</i>”;
or, “If I have Christ, I am not sorrowful.” In selecting
this motto, he may have had reference to his exiled
condition.</p>

<p>(There seems to be among the Schwenkfelders much
more regard than among most of our plain Pennsylvania
Germans for the pictures, the “counterfeit presentments,”
of men.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>The volumes given to myself, while among these
people, are:</p>

<p>1. Schwenkfeld’s <i>Erläuterung</i>, or Explanation, concerning
many points in history and theology. Not
written by their leader himself, but composed by several
of the “godly exiles from Silesia to Pennsylvania.” An
appendix contains, among other matter, a sketch of the
life of Schwenkfeld, and an account of the journey of
the Silesian emigrants from Altenau to this State. Of
this volume I have made much use.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>2. Questions on the Christian Doctrine of Faith, for
Instructing Youth in the First Principles of Religion.
By the Rev. Christopher Schultz, Sen. My copy is a
translation.</p>

<p>3. Constitution of the Schwenkfelder Society, subscribed
in 1782, etc.</p>

<h3>HISTORY.</h3>

<p>In the year 1490, seven years after the birth of Luther,
two years before the discovery of America by Columbus,
and one hundred and thirty-four before the birth of
George Fox, was born in Silesia,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in the German or
Austrian empire, Caspar Schwenkfeld von Ossing, of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
very old and noble extraction. His brother-in-law is
mentioned as Conrad Thumb von Neuburg, hereditary
marshal of the principality of Würtemberg. Caspar
Schwenkfeld was a person of very handsome mien,
dignified behavior, remarkable modesty, courtesy, and
gentleness, accompanied by godliness, and fervency in
prayer, and was of a Christian, pure, and temperate
life. It is added that thus much even his bitter enemies
must acknowledge, “as the clergy know.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In his
youth he studied two years at Cologne, and lived several
years at other universities. He at length became well
read in the writings of the Greek and Latin fathers.
He was also many years in the confidential service of
his liege lord, the Prince of Liegnitz (the Duke of
Liegnitz?). Afterwards “God touched his heart,” and
he turned away from his life at court, and became a
teacher at St. John’s Church, in Liegnitz. He diligently
read the writings of Luther and of others who were
leaving the papacy, and he afterwards remarked that he
had been as good a Lutheran as any. With the fiery reformer
he, however, differed greatly afterwards; the first
cause of difference being, as it appears, Luther’s views
upon the Supper. Schwenkfeld says that the Lord Jesus
had shown to him that he was not a bodily bread, but a
spiritual and heavenly one.</p>

<p>Schwenkfeld also wrote a little work upon the misuse
of the sacraments, which, without his knowledge, was
printed in Switzerland. Hereupon Dr. Faber, bishop at
Vienna, represented to the emperor, Ferdinand, that
Schwenkfeld held false doctrines concerning the sacrament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
of the Supper, etc.; and Ferdinand was himself
angry because his enemies had published the book. The
emperor (or, as he is called, the king) wrote to the duke
at Liegnitz to punish Schwenkfeld, but as his innocence
was known to the duke, this prince thought it well that
Schwenkfeld should ride away for a while.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>He did ride away in 1529, but, although he lived for
thirty-three years after, he never rode back again.</p>

<p>He travelled to many places in Germany, and was
prized and heard at many noble courts. Many times he
stopped in cities of the empire, and suffered much opposition
from the preachers.</p>

<p>A letter of pardon was sent to him by the emperor,
Ferdinand, saying that if he would recall his opinion,
and act differently, he should receive his knightly possessions;
but, as already stated, he never returned to
Silesia.</p>

<p>During his life he published ninety-two treatises, and
after his death many of his books were published by his
fellow-believers. All his writings were forbidden to be
printed by the Papists and Lutherans, and in different
places his writings were burnt, “nevertheless God has
given means for several of these books to be published
four or five times.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Many years after the publication of his little work,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
before spoken of, upon the misuse of the sacraments,
Schwenkfeld sent to Luther a number of his own works,
and called Luther’s attention to one of his favorite doctrines,
“the glory of the manhood of Jesus Christ.” To
the noble messenger who bore the letter, etc., Luther
returned an answer, speaking in severe and ignominious
terms of the author, reproaching him with having
kindled a fire in Silesia against the holy sacrament, and
with his Eutychianism, as Luther calls Schwenkfeld’s
doctrine that the manhood of Jesus Christ is no creature.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>It was not the desire of Schwenkfeld to build up a
sect of his own, nor did he judge any congregation already
collected, but he exhorted all to pray in spirit and
in truth in all places. He is said to have directed men
only to Christ and his power, and to have filled, until
his death, the office of a true evangelical preacher.</p>

<p>Before he departed, we read that he heard a voice,
“Up, up into heaven!” which voice he had heard also
before he rode out of his fatherland, saying, “Up, up
out of the fire!” (His hearing had failed nearly forty
years before his death.)</p>

<p>Not long before dying he said, “Now home; home
into the true fatherland.”</p>

<p>“He died in God, and went home to his rest,” in the
city of Ulm, in 1562.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>He was buried in a cellar. (It may be remembered
that Menno was buried in a garden.)</p>

<p>Nearly three hundred years after the birth of Caspar
Schwenkfeld von Ossing, the first Schwenkfeld congregation
was organized; he was born in 1490, it was
formed in 1782. It was upon the new continent discovered
by Columbus, in the English colony of Pennsylvania,
that a little band of exiled Schwenkfelders
formed this society after they had sojourned here nearly
fifty years. How were they able to continue Schwenkfelders,
during the period of more than two hundred
years between the death of their founder and their
organization here?<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In Silesia the ruling church was Roman Catholic, but
the Lutherans were generally tolerated. The Lutheran
preachers, coming into contact with the Schwenkfelders,
were often hostile and unfriendly to them; but the final
self-banishment of the Pennsylvania colony was owing
to the rigorous measures taken by the Jesuits for their
conversion.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>In one of the persecutions of earlier times, we read of
a certain Anthony Oelssner, who was called to strengthen
the scattered faithful, about the year 1580; in which call
he showed great diligence in prayer and preaching, until
he was seized and lay imprisoned a while at Liegnitz.
Afterward he was imprisoned at Löwenberg, in the
tower, where he suffered almost the same strong temptations
of Satan as we read in the lives of the fathers that
old Anthony did, from which he was happily set free, as
he writes in a long letter. One of his letters is from the
lowest dungeon at Vienna, where he lay among thieves
and malefactors.</p>

<p>He was also dragged about in the trenches and galleys,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
all which he bore without a murmur, and met his
persecutors with cheerfulness, encouraging the faithful
by letters when he did not lie in dungeons too dark, or
when ink, paper, etc., were not denied him. Of these
writings a great part is still extant.</p>

<p>Certain of the Schwenkfelder prisoners, it seems, were
sent upon the galleys to the Turkish war. “In taking
the castle Gran, in 1593, they were obliged to go before
the soldiers, through a narrow street; but they never
killed a Turk, nor stained their hands with the blood of
men (as is proper for the soldiers of Christ).”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>Another sufferer, old Martin John, tells how, when
he lived at Kaufig, he beheld the lives of the priests,
how they loaded themselves with eating and drinking,
avarice and gaming, dancing and debauchery, and produced
uproar in the beer-houses, and made a nine-pin
alley, and played together in the parsonage yard. “And
I thought that I could not any longer approve their
godlessness. I was thus induced to stay at home, and
read to my wife and children, and call them to repentance.
Then the priest ran to my landlord,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and complained
of me, but he would not listen, and I was left in
peace for a year. Then my old master died, and his
son, to please the godless preacher, drove me from my
paternal inheritance.” The priest was named George
M., and this was in 1584.</p>

<p>Martin John also says that the priest made jest of the
Holy Ghost, saying, “Thou wilt have to wait long
before the Holy Ghost will come and teach thee.”</p>

<p>Martin tells further, that he found a property cheap at
Armenruh; but there he saw the same manner of life.
“I did not have to go far, but heard in my own yard
how the priest fiddled, and the rest danced and cried
out, and found it much worse than in my own (former)
home. So I stayed at home, and read, prayed, and sang,
and other people came to hear. Then the priests ran
to our landlords, and we were put into prison, where
I was kept over four years, and the others over a year,
and to these nothing was given to eat nor to drink.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>These cases of persecution all took place within fifty
years after the death of Schwenkfeld, and seem to have
befallen those who lived around the Spitzberg, in Lower
Silesia; but in Upper Silesia, and in the district of
Glatz, there was repose; and toward the end of the
sixteenth century persecution appears to have declined,
for <i>we do not find that any one writes letters from prison</i>.</p>

<p>During the Thirty Years’ War the Schwenkfelders,
like others who opposed the Romish Church, did not
remain undisturbed. Once during this period complaint
was made of them to the prince at Liegnitz, but they
sent to him one of Caspar Schwenkfeld’s books, which
he graciously received, and permitted them to hold meetings
in their houses. Meetings in the open air were forbidden
by the emperor.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the war they were again persecuted,
the preachers complaining of them to the nobility. But
the prince at Liegnitz set them all free, and allowed
them to worship again in their houses.</p>

<p>Simple religious services, formerly held among the
Schwenkfelders, are thus described.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>If any one had books and read on Sunday, the others
went and listened. But this was the order: in the
morning, after each prayed when he rose, they came
together. (Elsewhere it is stated that they were generally
fasting.) They sang morning songs standing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
afterward prayed out of a prayer-book; then all,
standing, sang prayer-songs, especially to the Holy
Spirit; they also sang sitting, and prayed, and then
read several sermons; then prayed again and sang a
couple of songs; then ate dinner. Afterward prayed
again standing, and sang prayer-songs; afterward read
till toward evening; then standing prayed and sang.
That was the order on Sunday.</p>

<p>And if, in week-time, the people came together at a
spinning (<i>beym spinnen</i>), then there was almost always
singing, and when they would go home they knelt down
together and prayed.</p>

<p>In coming down to the year 1730, we read that there
being no longer any great persecution, the zeal of most
began to be extinguished; the young people liked to go
to church, especially at Harpersdorf, where there was
beautiful music. Some dreaded contempt; some, it is
said, found freedom to live in sin, for if they only went
to the Supper they might live as they pleased, and receive
a beautiful funeral sermon; many left on account
of a marriage. Thus the Schwenkfelders greatly declined.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>It was somewhat before the date above given, or in
the year 1719, that the celebrated Jesuit mission came
among the Schwenkfelders; that is, by imperial decree,
there arrived two missionary priests. In 1721, the
Schwenkfelders sent delegates to the emperor, craving
further indulgence.</p>

<p>While the missionaries were trying to make them
Catholic, the Lutherans offered protection to those who
should join them; but a few (“a little heap”) remained
true, without falling off on either side. Of the delegates
sent to the emperor, two remained in Vienna five years,
and found him not ungracious. He ordered that time
should be taken for further consideration.</p>

<p>During this time the mission was taking severe measures,
with fine and imprisonment. No Schwenkfelder
was to be buried in the churchyard, but upon the cattle-paths
(highways?), and none should accompany them to
burial (but this they could not prevent).<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> None should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
be married who did not promise their offspring to the
Catholics, which none would do; therefore many marriages
were postponed for long years. On the contrary,
when the new Lutherans (converts) were buried there
was a great parade and procession, and a great throng at
weddings. At length, in 1725, a severe edict was issued
to oblige old and young to attend the mission teachings,
and the Schwenkfelders were threatened with being fastened
to wheelbarrows (<i>Schübkarren</i>), and with having
their children taken away.</p>

<p>Now when affairs had come to an extremity, they
heard that they might flee for a while to an honorable
senator in Gorlitz, and also to his excellency Louis,
Count of Zinzendorf, and Lord of Berthelsdorf;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and
in 1726, and afterward, several families broke off by
night, and in great danger, leaving their estates and
property behind. More followed, and as they could
better earn a living in the villages,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> the greater part
went to Berthelsdorf, and enjoyed protection there for
eight years. But while living here in all stillness, in
1733, Zinzendorf informed them unexpectedly that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
were no longer to be tolerated in Saxony. In this
matter they suspected the influence of the Jesuits with
the elector. (Zinzendorf himself was banished from
1736 to 1747.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>)</p>

<p>One year was allowed them before removing, and,
after looking elsewhere, they concluded to come to Pennsylvania.
In 1733 a couple of Schwenkfelder families
had come hither,—and, as they say, “Our faithful friends
in Holland advised us strongly to go.” About forty
families, therefore, began the journey in the latter part
of April, 1734, and cast anchor at Philadelphia on the
22d of September. “There, by the praiseworthy constitution
of the country, we were made citizens, and partakers
of all civil and religious freedom.”</p>

<p>After this flight the missionaries continued their efforts
in Silesia, and several more families fled and came to
Pennsylvania. In 1740 an imperial command was
issued, that the Schwenkfelder heresy must out. Now
were they greatly urged to join the Lutherans for their
protection; and now, in houses, two were against three,
and three against two, and a man’s foes were those of
his own household. At last, the greater part went over
to the Lutheran Church. However, in the following
autumn, the emperor died, and Silesia was soon after
conquered for Prussia by Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>All the Roman Catholic offices were then vacated, and
Pater Regent, one of the mission, “retreated after us into
Saxony; and other instruments sought shelter out of the
country. The books of which we were robbed by the
doctors and their followers were, we heard, taken to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Liegnitz; and as for the homes and goods we had left
behind, they had helped themselves to them, which is all
one to us. We hope their enjoyment of them will be as
profitable to them as the abandoning of them has been
to us.”</p>

<p>In 1742, or eight years after the principal migration
to Pennsylvania, the King of Prussia published an edict
in favor of freedom of conscience, inviting the exiled
Schwenkfelders to return to his duchy of Lower Silesia,
or to dwell in any other part of his possessions. No
further persecution afflicted these people, but they have
become extinct in Europe, the last having died in 1826.</p>

<h3>THE JOURNEY TO AMERICA.</h3>

<p>When these wandering people no longer found a place
of refuge in Saxony, in April of 1734 about forty families
began that journey to Pennsylvania already spoken
of. This was completed in September, in a period of
about five months. An account of this long voyage is
given at the close of the book already often referred to,
the <i>Erläuterung</i>, or Explanation.</p>

<p>In Altona (near Hamburg), during a stay of eleven
days, they received great hospitalities from the Herren
v. Smissen, father and son.</p>

<p>On arriving at Haarlem (from some of whose citizens
they had received contributions while still in Saxony),
they could not enough admire the common joy and
proofs of love with which they were received. The
brothers Abraham, Isaac, and Jann v. Byuschanse were
especially kind, entertaining them with flesh, fish, all
kinds of vegetables, beer, coffee, and tea, and besides the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
children were daily presented with all kinds of baked
gingerbread and such things.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>As regarded the journey of the exiles to America, the
Herren v. Byuschanse had made an agreement with the
captain at their own expense.</p>

<p>Two days’ journey from Holland, Gregory Meschter
was presented with a healthy little son. Fifteen days
they lay at Haarlem, and at Rotterdam, on the 21st of
June, they went on board the English ship “St. Andrew,”
Captain Stedman commander. While they lay still one
week on board this vessel, “God gave David Schubert a
young son.”</p>

<p>On the 28th they left Rotterdam. On the 16th of
July, six Palatinate women and two men fought each
other, and she who began it received her deserts.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>At Plymouth, England, which they left on the 29th,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
a rich woman gave the whole ship’s company one hundred
and twenty-five shillings, and when it was divided
each person received four and a half stivers, English.
(The stiver is a Dutch coin of the value of one English
penny, or two cents in our money.)</p>

<p>On the 9th of August a Palatinate mother and daughter
fought each other. On the 10th a great fish was seen,
which spurted water on high powerfully, as if out of pipes.
(Our inland Silesians were not familiar with whales.)</p>

<p>A number of children and several grown persons died
upon the sea. On September 22d, “God be forever
thanked,” the anchor was happily cast before Philadelphia,
and guns were fired. On the 23d, all males over
sixteen had to go to the court-house to take the oath of
fidelity to the King of Great Britain. “We Silesians,
as on account of conscience we could not swear, were
readily excused, and were allowed to promise faith by
giving the hand” (<i>mit einem Handschlage</i>).</p>

<h3>THE ANNIVERSARY OR YEARLY MEETING.</h3>

<p>I asked a Schwenkfelder, “What are the exercises of
your commemorative festival?” He answered, “It is a
day of thanksgiving to God, that we live under a free
government, where we can serve him according to our
conscience.”</p>

<p>An animated description of the day has been given by
the Rev. C. Z. Weiser, in the <i>Mercersburg Review</i>. This
article, although apparently not quite true to history,
and though written in a peculiar style, has a sprightliness
which interests the reader.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Weiser tells us, that whoever is not providentially
prevented is bound to attend their yearly reunion.
Nor has it been found necessary thus far to enter an
urging statute to secure the presence of the fraternity.
The “seeding” is done, the corn stands in shocks, and
the farm-work of September is timely put aside, in order
that all may participate in the memorial ceremonies of
the 24th with a light, gay, and thankful heart.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It is
on the day and day before that you may feast your eyes
on many a well-laden carriage, the horses all in good
condition, moving on toward one of the Schwenkfelder
meeting-houses, selected in rotation, and one whole year
in advance. The aged and infirm of both sexes stay not
behind. The young men and women are largely and
promptly there. The fathers are similarly enough clad
to be considered uniformed. So too are the mothers arrayed
in a manner very like to one another, with snow-white
caps and bonnets that never vary. The sons and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
daughters do indeed not love the habits of their elders
any the less, yet only the wicked world’s a little more.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The morning service opens at nine o’clock, and is
filled out with singing, praying, and recitals of portions
of their ancestral history. All is gone through with in
the Pennsylvania German dialect, but withal reverentially,
solemnly, and earnestly, just as though it were
newly and for the first time done.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>At twelve o’clock, the noonday feast is set. This is
the feature of the day. It consists of light and newly-baked
rye bread, sweet and handsomely printed butter,
and the choicest apple-butter.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Nothing beyond these is
set, but these are of the first water. The bare benches,
but lately occupied by devout worshippers, serve as tables,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
along which the guests are lined out. Not in silence,
nor in sullenness, do they eat their simple meal, but
spicing it with cheerful talk, they dine with hearts full
of joy. Still, you need fear no profane utterance or silly
jest. They are mindful of the spirit of the occasion,
of the place in which they congregate, and of the feast
itself, which the singing of some familiar hymn has consecrated.
If any one thirst, let him drink cold water.</p>

<p>And now think not that they feign simply to eat and
drink,—that the meal from first to last is but a poor pretence.
A full and hearty dinner is “made out” there.
It is a bona fide eating and drinking that is done in the
meeting-house of the Schwenkfelders on their <i>Gedächtniss
Tag</i> (Remembrance Day). They are all hard-working
men and women,—farmers and farmers’ wives and
farmers’ children. They are sunburnt, healthy, and
hungry besides. And why should they not relish the
sweet bread, with their sweet butter and apple-butter,
then? Even strangers who attend and are hospitably
entertained by the society show that one can make a full
hand, even at such a table.</p>

<p>At two o’clock the tables become pews again, and the
afternoon exercises are conducted according to the programme
of the morning. These concluded, a general
invitation is again extended to partake of the baskets of
fragments gathered up and stored away in the rear of
the meeting-house. A fraternal hand-shaking closes
the anniversary for the year. The reflection that many
part now who may never meet again on earth causes
tears to trickle down some furrowed cheek, which generally
prove more or less contagious, as is always the
case in a company of hearts, when those tears flow in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
sincere channels. Hence, though all were happy all day
long, they now feel sad.</p>

<p>To appreciate the meaning and spirit of this apparently
homely scene, it is necessary to know that it is a
memorial service all through. It was on this very 24th
of September, 1734, that some seventy [forty] families
of Schwenkfelders, who had landed on the 22d, and
declared their allegiance on the 23d, held their thanksgiving
service, in gratitude to God for a safe deliverance
to the colony of Pennsylvania. They had arrived
in the ship “St. Andrew,” at Philadelphia, as fugitives
from Silesia.</p>

<p>Poor, but feeling rich in view of their long-sought
liberty, they blessed God in an open assembly. We
may judge their store and fare to have been scant and
lean indeed; and to perpetuate the original service of
their forefathers from generation to generation, they
statedly celebrate their <i>Gedächtniss Tag</i>.</p>

<p>The poor fare before them is finely designed to impress
the sore fact of their ancestors’ poverty indelibly
upon their minds, memories, and hearts. They eat and
drink in remembrance of former days,—the days of
small things. They join thereto at the same time a
gladsome worship, in thankfulness for the asylum opened
up for them from their former house of bondage, and
which proved so fair a heritage to their people ever
since.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<h3>CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p>A lawyer of Norristown tells me that he taught a
subscription school among the Schwenkfelders, some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
thirty years ago, and a day or two before the school
closed he sent out his bills by the scholars. Every cent
of the money due was paid in on the next morning,—and
as he was then poor this was a delightful and memorable
circumstance.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Further, I find it laid down as a rule of their community
that members must see to it that their debts are
paid without legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Another instance of exactness in money matters is
given in their history, namely, that while they were
sojourning with or near Zinzendorf, some of their well-wishers
in Holland sent to them a considerable contribution
in money, of which they knew nothing until the
merchants of Gorlitz announced and paid it to them.
By their diligence in labor, and their skilful use of this
money, they were able to supply the pressing wants of
their poor, and to pay the expenses of the same to Altona.
On their arrival at Haarlem, a little that remained
was laid at the feet of their noble benefactors.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>I met with a young Dunker woman, in the neighborhood
of the Schwenkfelder community, who said, “The
poor always find their way to the Schwenkfelders;” and
on my mentioning this subject at one of the houses which
I visited, my host told me of persons having come to
his house asking “how far they had to the Schwenkfelder
<i>Thal</i>” (or valley).</p>

<p>The language spoken at two of the houses which I
visited was almost entirely the Pennsylvania German;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
but my ignorance of the dialect forbids my knowing
whether these Silesian emigrants speak it differently
from the South German Palatines.</p>

<p>My power of talking German was perhaps never more
exercised in the same length of time than during my
visit here; the women and children in the houses alluded
to speaking no English. In the second, the
mother, who was in delicate health, had been reading
German books, but was unable to read English. A
like circumstance is certainly very uncommon, if not
unknown, among the “Dutch” of my own county.</p>

<p>Neither does there appear to be the same objection to
education there that exists among some of our people
here. One of the Schwenkfelders said to me that he
told his boys to learn as much as they can; “I’d not
seen a man yet that had been too wise; and the girls
may do the same.” He also told me that they do not
neglect to teach the children in their family to read
and write German, a custom which tends to preserve
the purity of the language. But the Schwenkfelders
find it difficult to preserve a knowledge of German,
since the language is no longer taught in the public
schools in their neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Like Quakers, Dunkers, etc., the Schwenkfelders have
an unpaid ministry. One whom I met, who had been
a preacher, cultivated fourteen acres of ground, and
joined to this labor the mechanical occupations of making
brooms and cigar boxes. I said to one of the society,
“You do not pay your ministers?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “but they are excused from all
church expenses, such as the treasury for the poor, and
building and keeping in repair our meeting-houses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
Then, as one minister will be a farmer and another a
mechanic, and one is called upon to leave his shop and
the other his farm to attend funerals, we generally make
such a one a present.</p>

<p>“It has been at times the case that presents have been
offered to men in good circumstances, who would answer,
thanking the giver, but they had no need of the gift; if
at any other time it should be necessary they would
accept it.”</p>

<p>Candidates for the ministry are elected by ballot; the
votes being collected in a hat. Women do not vote, and
of course they do not preach. If the candidates when
elected prove to be “men of able tongues,” they are confirmed.
Formerly the Schwenkfelders did not vote for
preachers, but it seemed to them that the right kind did
not come forward, and those who did come forward were
not always desirable persons.</p>

<p>The sacraments of baptism and the supper have never
been held among them.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> A modern custom, originating
in this country, and established in 1823, has thus been
described: After the birth of a child, it is brought by
the parents into church, and a preacher prays for the
happiness and prosperity of the child, and admonishes
the parents to bring it up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord, according to the will of God. Then there
is prayer, and the singing of some appropriate verses.
If the child or mother is delicate, this service is sometimes
performed at their house.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>Not only are the Schwenkfelders forbidden to become
soldiers, but also to train in military exercises. Upon
this point, however, the late rebellion seems to have tried
some of their members, as it did some Quakers.</p>

<p>“Do you bring lawsuits?” said I to a member.</p>

<p>“Not if we can help it. I never brought a lawsuit,
nor had one brought against me, and hope I never
shall.”</p>

<h3>DOCTRINES.</h3>

<p>In plainness of speech, behavior, and apparel, in opposition
to war, to oaths, and to a paid ministry, in a
belief in the teachings of the Divine Spirit and in the
inferiority of the written word to the indwelling Spirit,
in discarding religious forms, in opposition to priest-craft
or a hierarchy, and, although not practising silent
worship, yet in their desire to live “in the stillness,” the
Schwenkfelders resemble Quakers. We might almost
say that they are Quakers of an older type (Quakers it
may be of whom George Fox had never heard). They
differ from Quakers in employing stated prayers, in
electing preachers, in not acknowledging the spiritual
equality of women, and in their peculiar doctrine of the
“glory of the manhood of Jesus Christ,—how it is no
creature.”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>We give from the <i>Erläuterung</i>, or Explanation, some
striking extracts upon some of these points. Upon the
word of God, Schwenkfeld and Illyricus had a violent
contest. Schwenkfeld holds that the tables upon which
God writes, and the book or paper upon which man
writes, are entirely two kinds of thing: between all
printed and written books in the world and the true
word of God a fundamental difference is to be maintained.
The word is a living, internal, spiritual word,
and can only be contained in the book of the believing
heart.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Faith existed many hundred years before the
Scripture. It proceeded from the eternal Word or Son
of God, Jesus Christ, and from God, the All-powerful.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Against what are called “the means of grace”
Schwenkfeld preached. (Spiritual things, it is said,
come not through canals.) Schwenkfeld maintained that
Christ is only to be sought above with the Father, and
thence we must all draw that which will make us upright
and blessed. This was also recognized by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
leaders who came out from the papacy; but there came
a time when they taught that Christ and salvation were
to be found below in external works and worship. But
Schwenkfeld neither could nor would admit that Christ
and the Holy Spirit were in outward works of preaching
and hearing and in elements of this earthly existence, in
water, bread, and wine.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>On baptism we find the following: The first and
most eminent work of the sacrament of baptism is, the
internal grace of inworking faith in the love of God,
which moves, glows, and lives through the outpouring
of the heavenly waters which flow from the Word of
God, which is Christ. The other point is the external
word and water which is outwardly poured upon and
washes the body outwardly as the internal does the soul.</p>

<p>John the Baptist says, “I baptize with water to
repentance, but he who comes after me will baptize you
with the Holy Ghost and with fire.” Here he distinguishes
the work of the minister from the office of the
Lord, and the visible water from the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Ambrose says, “Peter has not purified, nor Ambrose,
nor Gregory, for ours is the ministry, but thine, Lord,
are the sacraments. It is not the work of man to give
divine things, thine is it, Lord, and the Father’s, who
says through the prophets [prophet,] I will pour out my
Spirit upon all flesh.”</p>

<p>That the subject of the Holy Supper is especially
weighty may be judged by the agitations on account
of it, and by the fact that on this account many thousands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
in many lands have been killed and burnt. And
this was the article upon which the Reformers, with their
gloriously begun work, fell to pieces. Upon this article
Luther renounced his friendship to Schwenkfeld, and
they publicly differed.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Schwenkfeld thought that when they came out from
the papacy they should preach the gospel in its purity,
instruct old and young in the catechism, and earnestly
pray until they could come to the right use of the
sacrament.... Whereby whole parishes, towns, and
countries should not at once be taken up, as if fit for the
table of the Lord. But it should be held with those
who received the word, and in whom there were tokens
of amendment, whether these were only Caleb and
Joshua. Schwenkfeld declared that he had no command
to establish the sacraments, but his command had been
to spread the gospel and point every man to Jesus
Christ. “But we are comforted that we are instructed
by God and from the Holy Scripture that our soul’s
salvation is necessarily placed on no outward thing, but
that one thing is needful.” (Luke x.) “But we pray
the Lord Jesus Christ that he will reveal a right use of
the sacraments, and himself establish them. We strive,
moreover, to hold his supper daily with the Lord Christ,
in the spirit of faith.” (Rev. iii.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>) But though Schwenkfeld
did not feel called upon to establish the sacraments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
there is nothing in the catechism of the society opposed
to the external rites.</p>

<p>The twelfth chapter of the Explanation, containing
nearly eighty pages, is devoted to Schwenkfeld’s peculiar
doctrine, of which I shall content myself with the heading
of the chapter, as follows: “Of the divine Sonship
and glory of the Manhood of Jesus Christ, that the
same is no creature, but extinguished in the Transfiguration,
and changed into the Godhead.”</p>

<p>To one passage in the Catechism I would like to call
attention:</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—How did God reveal himself in an external
manner?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>—First, when God, by his almighty word,
framed the universe, by which he has shown how great,
almighty, wise, and good he is.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>And now may we not also rest our souls upon these
expressions from the constitution of the Schwenkfelder
society, translated almost literally?</p>

<p>In the nature of God, we first perceive love as that
noble and outflowing power which binds God and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
men together.... If the society build upon this
fundamental part of the divine nature, namely, love,
then their only immovable aim will be, first, the glory
of God, and second, the promotion of the common weal
of every member.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The preceding article is published nearly as it appeared
in the second edition of this work, which was issued late
in 1873, with the date 1874. Almost as soon as the
edition appeared, I learned that baptism had been introduced
among the Schwenkfelders at a meeting held a
few months before; and that perhaps in two cases it had
also been administered at the approach of death.</p>

<p>In the spring of the present year, 1882, I visited a
Schwenkfelder settlement in the upper part of Montgomery
County, and was hospitably entertained at the
house of one of their preachers. German or the Pennsylvania
dialect was the language of the family. On
Sunday I attended church, where, as before in another
locality, the services were in German, as were nearly all
the proceedings in the Sunday-school. Here I learned
that the rite of the Supper has also been introduced
among the Schwenkfelders, though not without opposition.
I inquired on what grounds the opposition was
brought, but received no satisfactory reply.</p>

<p class="tb">At the house of my entertainer I was shown a volume,
published in 1879, containing a genealogical record of
the descendants of the Schwenkfelders in this country,
to which is prefixed a historical sketch by C. Heydrick,
a lawyer of Franklin, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>Herein it is stated that Schwenkfeld differed with
Luther on several points; chiefly on the eucharist, the
efficacy of the divine word, the human nature of Christ,
and baptism.</p>

<p>Schwenkfeld held, says the writer, that the penitent
believer partakes of the bread and the body of the Lord,
not only at the sacramental altar, but elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the second point Schwenkfeld denied that the external
word in the Scriptures has the power of healing
and renewing the mind, but ascribed this power to the
internal word, Christ himself. He regretted that Luther,
who at first agreed with him, saw fit afterward to ascribe
to the written or preached word the efficacy which is only
in Christ, the eternal word.</p>

<p>Further, Schwenkfeld rejected infant baptism, and
held that baptism and the Supper were not intended as
means by which the unregenerate partaker can obtain
salvation.</p>

<p class="tb">Two other volumes on these subjects have very lately
come within my notice. One in German, by a pastor
named Kadelbach, published about 1860, at Lauban,
which is within forty miles of the city of Liegnitz,
where Schwenkfeld was canon in a church. As early
as 1846, in composing a history of the village of
Probsthayn (where some of the Schwenkfelders formerly
lived), he added to it some material concerning
these people.</p>

<p>As this subject attracted attention, he endeavored to
obtain material for a history of them, in which matter
he met with much difficulty. It came to pass, however,
that the Schwenkfelders in America sent an inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
to the burgomaster of Probsthayn, asking whether
there were still Schwenkfelder communities (<i>Gemeinden</i>)
there. This inquiry came, in 1855, into the hands of
Kadelbach, who was very glad to communicate with the
Schwenkfelders in America, as he had never before been
able to do. His volume is called “Complete History
of Kaspar von Schwenkfeld and of the Schwenkfelders
in Silesia, Upper Lusatia, and America.”<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> A copy has
been placed in the archives of the German Society’s
library in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We may inter that the attention of the author was
attracted to his subject by certain local objects or remains.
He tells us that the Catholic chapel at Harpersdorf,
and the graves on the cow-path (<i>viehweg</i>), are
the last memorials that testify of the existence there,
and of the persecution of the Schwenkfelders. The
Catholic chapel was built for one of the missionaries
who was striving to convert them. As to the graves
on the cow-paths, the statement has before been quoted
(in a note on <a href="#Page_222">page 222</a>), that three hundred persons lay
upon the cow-paths at Harpersdorf and Langenneudorff
(or Langendorff).</p>

<p>The other volume in which the Schwenkfelders are
especially noticed is Barclay’s Inner Life of the Religious
Societies of the Commonwealth. London, 1876.
Barclay finds that on several points the teaching of
Schwenkfeld was identical with that of George Fox, the
first Quaker. Barclay gives a passage from Schwenkfeld,
in which he says that the true knowledge of Christ,
that which is according to the Holy Ghost must be expected,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
not alone out of the Scriptures, but much more
from the gifts of grace revealed by the Father, yet so
that this revelation should always be in unison with the
witness of the Scriptures.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Struck with the similarity between the Schwenkfelders
and Quakers, Barclay appears to have written to the
former, and to have received an answer, from which the
following passages are taken:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To Robert Barclay, England:</p>

<p>... “Judging from the brief notices of the teachings
of George Fox in our possession, we have reason
to believe that they did not differ materially from
those of Schwenkfeld, and among the followers of
both, here in America, there is a striking similarity
in the almost total absence of formalities and ceremonies
in their religious practices. Both are discarding
judicial oaths, carnal weapons, and are unostentatious
in dress.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the fact that the Friends are of
English descent, having their books, worship, and conversation
in the English language, and the followers of
Schwenkfeld here all of it in German, yet there always
existed a lively sympathy, love, and esteem between the
parties.... It is, however, proper to mention the fact
that neither in Europe nor here have the followers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Schwenkfeld at any time administered baptism and the
Lord’s Supper.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>“Owing to the persecutions which prevailed from
1630 to 1640, the religious practices of our ancestors in
Germany about that period were chiefly confined to
meeting in private houses for prayer and admonition,
and in endeavors in the daily work of life to imitate as
much as possible the example of the heavenly Master.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_FRIEND">A FRIEND.</h2>

</div>

<p>About twenty miles from the line that divides Maryland
and Pennsylvania, there stands, in the latter State,
a retired farm-house, which was erected more than fifty
years ago by Samuel Wilson, a Quaker of Quakers.</p>

<p>His was a character so rare in its quaintness and its
nobility, that it might serve as a theme for a pen more
practised and more skilful than the one that now essays
to portray it.</p>

<p>Samuel Wilson was by nature romantic. When comparatively
young, he made a pedestrian tour to the Falls
of Niagara, stopping upon his return journey, and hiring
with a farmer to recruit his exhausted funds; and when
he had passed his grand climacteric, the enthusiasm of
his friendship for the young, fair, and virtuous, still
showed the poetic side of his character.</p>

<p>Veneration induced him to cherish the relics of his
ancestry,—not only the genealogical tree, which traced
the Wilsons back to the time of William Penn, and the
marriage certificates of his father and grandfather, according
to the regular order of the Society of Friends;
but such more humble and familiar heirlooms as the tall
eight-day clock, and the high bookcase upon a desk and
chest of drawers, that had been his father’s, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
the strong kitchen-chairs and extremely heavy fire-irons
of his grandfather.</p>

<p>To this day there stands beside the Wilson farm-house
a stone taken from one of the buildings erected
by Samuel’s father, and preserved as an heirloom. Upon
it the great-grandchildren read nearly the following inscription:</p>

<p>“James Wilson, ejus manus scripsit. [His hand
wrote.] Deborah Wilson, 5 mo. 23d, 1757.”</p>

<p>Samuel Wilson, having been trained from his earliest
years to that plainness of speech in which the Discipline
requires that Friends bring up those under their care,
not only discarded in speaking the simple titles in use in
common conversation, but did not himself desire to be
addressed as Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>A colored woman, the wife of one of his tenants, said
that he refused to answer her when she thus spoke to
him.</p>

<p>A pleasant euphemism was generally employed by
these people in addressing him. He and his wife were
“Uncle Samuel” and “Aunt Anna” to their numerous
dependents.</p>

<p>The apparel of Samuel and Anna was of the strict
pattern of their own religious sect. To employ a figure
of speech, it was the “wedding-garment,” without which,
at that time and place, they would not have become
elders in their society, and thus been entitled to sit with
ministers, etc., upon the rising seats that faced the rest
of the meeting.</p>

<p>But the plainness of Uncle Samuel was not limited to
the fashion of his own garments. When Aunt Anna had
made for her son a suit of domestic cloth, dyed brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
with the hulls of the black walnut, and had arrayed
him in his new clothes, of which the trousers were made
roomy behind,—or, as the humorist says, “baggy in the
reverse,”—she looked upon him with maternal pride and
fondness, and exclaimed, “There’s my son!”</p>

<p>For this ejaculation she was not only reproved at the
time by her husband, but in after-years, whenever he
heard her, as he thought, thus fostering in the mind of
their dear and only child pride in external appearance,
he repeated the expression, “There’s my son!” which
saying conveyed a volume of reproof.</p>

<p>From this and other circumstances of the kind, it may
be supposed that Friend Wilson was a cold or bitter
ascetic. But he possessed a vein of humor, and could
be gently and pleasantly rallied when he seemed to run
into extremes. But, though his intellect was good, the
moral sentiments predominated in his character. His
head was lofty and arched. His wants were very few;
he possessed an ample competence, and he had no ambition
to enter upon the fatiguing chase after riches. He
disliked acquisitive men as much as the latter despised
him. “I want so little for myself,” he said, “I think
that I might be allowed to give something away.”</p>

<p>Sometimes—but rarely—a little abruptness was seen
in his behavior. He had the manners of a gentleman
by birth,—tender and true, open to melting charity,
thinking humbly of himself, and respecting others.</p>

<p>The vein of humor to which I have alluded prompted
the reply which he made on a certain occasion to a mechanic
or laboring man employed in his own family. In
this section of Lancaster County the farming population
is composed principally of a laborious and in some respects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
a humble-minded people, who sit at table and eat
with their hired people of both sexes.</p>

<p>The same custom was pursued by Samuel and Anna;
but, as their hired people were mostly colored, they sometimes
offended the prejudices or tastes of many who were
not accustomed to this equality of treatment, which was
maintained by several families of Friends. The white
hired man to whom I have alluded, when he perceived
who were seated at the table, hesitated or refused to sit
down among them. As soon as Samuel was conscious of
the difficulty, for which indeed his mind was not unprepared,
he thus spoke aloud to his wife: “Anna, will thee
set a plate at that other table for this stranger? He does
not want to sit down with us.” And his request was
quietly obeyed. The man who was thus set apart probably
became tired of this peculiar seclusion, for he did
not stay long at the Quaker homestead.</p>

<p>I think that Samuel was also in a humorous mood
when he called that unpretending instrument, the accordion,—from
which his daughter-in-law was striving one
evening to draw forth musical sounds,—“Mary’s fiddle.”
But, indeed, he left the house and went to call upon a
neighbor, so greatly did he partake of that prejudice
which was felt by most Friends against music.</p>

<p>The Discipline asks whether Friends are punctual to
their promises; and (to quote a very different work)
Fielding tells us that Squire Allworthy was not only
careful to keep his greater engagements, but remembered
also his promises to visit his friends.</p>

<p>Anna Wilson on one occasion having thoughtlessly
made such a promise,—as, indeed, those in society frequently
do when their friends say, “Come and see us,”—was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
often reminded of it in after-years by her husband.
When he heard her lightly accepting such invitations, he
would reprove her by saying in private, “When is thee
going to see Benjamin Smith?”—the neighbor to whom
the ancient promise was still unfulfilled.</p>

<p>The hospitality which the Scriptures enjoin was practised
to a remarkable degree by Samuel and Anna. It
has always been customary in their religious society to
entertain Friends who come from a distance to attend
meetings, and those travelling as preachers, etc. But the
Wilson homestead was a place of rest and entertainment
for many more than these. It stood not far from the
great highway laid out by William Penn from Philadelphia
westward, and here called the “Old Road.”
Friends travelling westward in their own conveyance
would stop and refresh themselves and their horses at
the hospitable mansion, and would further say to their
own friends, “Thee’d better stop at Samuel Wilson’s.
Tell him I told thee to stop.” A further and greater
extent of hospitality I shall mention hereafter.</p>

<p>The Discipline asks whether Friends are careful to
keep those under their charge from pernicious books and
from the corrupt conversation of the world; and I have
heard that Samuel Wilson was grieved when his son
began to go to the post-office and take out newspapers.
Hitherto the principal periodical that came to the house
was <i>The Genius of Universal Emancipation</i>, a little
paper issued by that pioneer, Benjamin Lundy, who
was born and reared in the Society of Friends. It does
not appear, however, that the class of publications
brought from the little village post-office to the retired
farm-house were of the class usually called pernicious.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
They were <i>The Liberator</i>, <i>The Emancipator</i>, and others
of the same order.</p>

<p>Samuel himself became interested in them, but never
to the exclusion of the “Friends’ Miscellany,” a little
set of volumes containing religious anecdotes of Friends.
These volumes were by him highly prized and frequently
read.</p>

<p>It has been said that he was a humorist; and perhaps
he was partly jesting when he suggested that his
infant granddaughter should be named Tabitha. The
mother of the little one, on her part, suggested Helen.</p>

<p>“He-len!” the grandfather broke out in reply;
“does thee know who <i>she</i> was?” thus expressing his
antipathy to the character of the notorious beauty of
Greece. He did not insist, however, on endowing the
precious newly-born infant with that peculiar name
which is by interpretation Dorcas, the name of her
who, in apostolic times, was full of good works and
alms-deeds.</p>

<p>Friend Wilson shared the Quaker disregard for the
great holidays of the church. To the colored people
around him, who had been brought up at the South,
where Christmas is so great a festival,—where it was so
great a holiday for them especially,—it must have been
a sombre change to live in a family where the day
passed nearly like other working-days. One of the
colored men, however, who had started at the time of
the great festival to <i>take Christmas</i>, was seen, before
long, coming back; “for,” said he, “Massa Wilson don’t
’prove on’t nohow.”</p>

<p>Among the lesser peculiarities of Samuel Wilson was
his objection to having his picture taken,—an objection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
however, which is felt to this day by some strict people
belonging to other religious societies, but probably on
somewhat different grounds.</p>

<p>One who warmly loved and greatly respected Friend
Wilson took him once to the rooms of an eminent daguerreotypist,
hoping that while he engaged the venerable
man in looking at the objects around the room, the
artist might be able to catch a likeness. But Samuel
suspected some artifice, and no picture was taken. Some
time after, however, the perseverance of his friend was
rewarded by obtaining an excellent oil-painting of the
aged man, from whom a reluctant consent to sit for his
likeness had at length been obtained. It was remarked,
however, that the expression of the face in the painting
was sorrowful, as if the honorable man was grieved at
complying with a custom which he had long stigmatized
as idolatrous,—as idolatry of the perishing body.</p>

<p>Although at the time of the great division in the
Society of Friends Samuel Wilson had decidedly taken
the part of Elias Hicks, yet was he seldom or never
heard to discuss those questions of dogmatic theology
which some have thought were involved in that contest.</p>

<p>Samuel probably held, with many others of his Society,
that the highest and surest guide which man possesses
here is that Light which has been said to illumine
every man that comes into the world; that next in importance
is a rightly inspired gospel ministry, and afterward
the Scriptures of truth. One evening, when certain mechanics
in his employ were resting from their labors in
the old-fashioned kitchen, he fell into conversation with
them on matters of religion, and shocked one of his
family, as he entered the sitting-room, by a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
declaration of opinion. It was probably the uncommon
warmth of his manner which produced this effect, quite
as much as or more than the words that he spoke, which
were nearly as follows: “There’s no use talking about
it; the only religion in the world that’s worth anything
is what makes men do what is right and leave off doing
what is wrong.”</p>

<p>As far as was possible for one with so much fearless
independence of thought and action, Samuel Wilson
maintained the testimony of Friends against war. Not
only did he suffer his corn to be seized in the field rather
than voluntarily to pay the military taxes of the last war
with Great Britain, but he went to what may appear to
some a laughable extreme, in forbidding his young son’s
going to the turnpike to see the grand procession which
was passing near their house, escorting General Lafayette
on his last visit to this country. He was not, however,
alone in this. I have heard of other decided Friends
who declined to swell the ovation to a man who was
especially distinguished as a military hero. But we shall
see hereafter that Friend Wilson met with circumstances
which tried his non-resistant opinions further than they
would bear.</p>

<p>The distinctive trait of his character, however,—that
trait which made him exceptional,—was his attachment
to the people of color. It was in entertaining
fugitives from slavery that he showed the wide hospitality
already referred to; and in this active benevolence
he was excelled by few in our country. He inherited
from his father this love of man; but I have imagined
that the hostility to slavery was made broad and deep in
his soul by removing, with the rest of his family, in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
youth, from Pennsylvania into Delaware, and seeing the
bondage which was suffered by colored people in the
latter State contrasted with what he had seen in the
former. Be that as it may, no sooner was he a householder
than his door was ever open to those who were
escaping from the South, coming by stealth and in darkness,
having travelled in the slave States from the house
of one free negro to another, and in Pennsylvania from
Quaker to Quaker, until in later times the hostility to
slavery increased in our community so far that others
became agents of this underground railroad, and other
routes were opened.</p>

<p>When the Wilson family came down in the morning,
they saw around them these strange sable or yellow
travellers (“strangers,” they were called in the family),
who, having arrived during the night, had been received
by some wakeful member of the household.</p>

<p>What feelings filled the hearts of the exiles! Alone,
at times, having left all that they had ever loved of persons
or of places, fearful, tired, foot-sore, throwing themselves
upon the charity and the honor of a man unknown
to them save by name and the direction which they had
received to him, as one trustworthy.</p>

<p>Sometimes they came clothed in the undyed woollen
cloth that showed so plainly to one experienced in the
matter, the region of its manufacture; the heavy, strong
cloth which had delighted the wearer’s heart when he
received the annual Christmas suit with which his master
furnished him, but which was now too peculiar and
striking for him safely to wear. Women and children
came too, and sometimes in considerable numbers.</p>

<p>When they had eaten and partaken of the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
repose, they would communicate to Friend Wilson, in a
secure situation, some particulars of their former history,
especially the names and residences of the masters from
whom they had escaped.</p>

<p>Some years after he had begun to entertain these
strangers, Friend Wilson commenced a written record
of those who came to him, and whence and from whom
they had escaped. This list is estimated to have finally
contained between five and six hundred names.</p>

<p>The next care was to bestow new titles upon the
fugitives, that they might never be known by their
former names to the pursuer and the betrayer.</p>

<p>From what has been already said, it may be supposed
that these names were not always selected for their
euphony or æsthetic associations. One tall, finely-built
yellow man, who trembled when he was questioned in
the sitting-room, lest his conversation about his old
home and the free wife whom he longed to have
brought to him should be overheard in the kitchen,
expressed to me his dissatisfaction with his new name—Simon.
“I never knowed anybody named that,” he
said. His beautiful bright wife—bright in the <i>colored</i>
sense,—that is, bright-colored, or nearly white,—was
secretly and safely brought to him, and nursed him
through that fatal disease which made him of no value
in the man-market,—the market which had been the
great horror of his life. The particulars Friend Wilson
collected concerning his humble charge the venerable
man entered in his day-book, in a place especially assigned
to them. If this record were still existing, I
should, perhaps, be able to tell what name the fortunate
and unfortunate Simon had been obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
renounce. This record, however, is lost, as I shall
mention hereafter. If the services of any of these fugitives
were needed, within-doors or without, and the master’s
pursuit was not supposed to be imminent, they were
detained for a while, or perhaps became permanent residents
in the neighborhood; otherwise, they were forwarded
at night to Friends living nearer Philadelphia.
Of these, two other families willing to receive the poor
exiles lived about twelve miles farther on.</p>

<p>The house and farm were generally pretty well
stocked with colored people, who were a wonder to the
neighbors of the Wilson family; for these were in a
great measure “Pennsylvania Dutch,”—a people anxious
to do as much work with their own hands and by
the hands of their own family as possible, in order to
avoid expense. It is a remarkable circumstance that,
although Samuel Wilson during thirty years or more
entertained the humble strangers, and although he received
so large a number, only one of them was seized
upon his “plantation” and taken back to slavery. This
was owing partly to the secluded situation of his house,
and partly to the prudence and discretion that he exercised.
“He was crafty,” it has been said.</p>

<p>Neither did he suffer any legal expenses, such as lawsuits,
from the slaveholders who came in pursuit of their
fleeing bondmen. Two friends who lived not far from
him, and who prosecuted kidnappers, had their barns
burned, and others, of whom he had knowledge, suffered
great pecuniary loss in consequence of their assisting
runaway slaves. He, however, limited his care to receiving,
entertaining, and forwarding those who came to
him in person, and never undertook any measures of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
offence,—any border raids, so to speak,—such as sending
secretly into Maryland and Virginia for the relatives
and friends of fugitives who were still living in those
States as slaves. The one person of whom I have
spoken, who was recaptured from the Wilson farm, was
a young girl of fifteen or sixteen. Samuel and Anna
were absent from home at the time, gone on a little journey,
such as they frequently took, to attend their own
monthly and quarterly meetings; assisting to preserve
the discipline and order of the Society of Friends. The
men who came in pursuit of the young girl told her that
her friends, who had run away too, had concluded to go
back South again; and the poor child, under these circumstances,
could hardly do anything but go with the
beguilers; not, however, to find the friends whom she
expected.</p>

<p>There was also a man who was very near being taken,—a
man who had “come away,” to use the brief euphemism
sometimes employed in the Wilson family in
speaking of fugitives from slavery. He escaped by
having gone down the creek or adjacent mill-stream to
set his muskrat-traps. This creek where it ran by the
house was well wooded; therefore the colored man,
looking up to the house, could see the white strangers
without being seen himself. With what trembling did
he see that they were persons whom he “knowed in
Murrland,” as he expressed it! However, the friendly
woods sheltered him, while Samuel at the house was
talking with the slaveholder or his agents,—kidnappers,
as the Wilsons called them.</p>

<p>The men told Samuel that they had come after a runaway
nigger,—black, five feet ten inches high, lost one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of his front teeth, etc. To this description Friend Wilson
listened in silence. I do not know what he would
have done had he been directly questioned by them, for
the different items suited him of the muskrats,—the man
who had gone to the woods. But during Samuel’s continued
silence they went on to say, “He’s a very ornary
nigger; no dependence to be placed on him nohow.”
“There is no man here,” rejoined Samuel, greatly relieved,
“that answers the description.” “We’ve very
good reason to think he came here,” said one; “we got
word very direct; reckon he’s lyin’ around here. Hain’t
there been no strange nigger here?”</p>

<p>“There was a colored man here, but he has gone
away; I don’t know as he will ever come back again.”
For, from the man’s protracted absence, he doubtless
had some idea of his having seen his pursuers, and
having sought shelter.</p>

<p>“Tell him that his master says that if he will only
come back again, down to Baltimore County, he sha’n’t
be whipped, nor sold, nor nuthin’, but everything shall
be looked over.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him what you say,” said Samuel, “if ever I
see him again; but,” he added, regaining his accustomed
independence, “I’ll tell him, too, that if I was in his
place I’d never go back to you again.”</p>

<p>The men left, and under cover of the friendly night
the fugitive sought a more secure hiding place.</p>

<p>There was one heroic black man in whom Samuel
Wilson felt an abiding interest. When Jimmy Franklin
told the tale of his perilous escapes and recaptures
in the States of Maryland, North and South Carolina,
Georgia, and Florida,—when he showed the shot still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
remaining in his legs—shot that had been fired at him
as he ran, and, working through to the front, were perceived
through the skin, like warts upon his legs,—the
lads of the family looking and listening had their sympathies
enkindled in such a manner as could never entirely
die out. One of them, in after-years, was asked:</p>

<p>“How does thee account for that man’s persistent
love of freedom? What traits of character did he possess
that would account for his doing so much more than
others to escape from the far South?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply, in the freedom of
familiar conversation. “What was the reason that Fulton
invented his steamboat? or that Bacon wrote his
System? or that Napier invented logarithms?</p>

<p>“This man was a genius,—a greater man in his way
than those I spoke of. If he had had education, and
had been placed in circumstances to draw him out, he
would have been the leader in some great movement
among men.”</p>

<p>The narrative of James Franklin was written by a
dear friend of him whom I call Samuel Wilson, but is
supposed to have been burned when the mob destroyed
Pennsylvania Hall.</p>

<p>It was in relation to these fugitives that Samuel sometimes
forgot for a while his strictly peaceful principles;
for there were to be found among the men of color those
who could be induced to betray to the pursuers their
fugitive brethren, giving such information as would lead
to their recapture; or, if they should escape this, to their
being obliged to abandon their resting-places and to flee
again for safety.</p>

<p>It was in talking of some such betrayer that Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
Wilson said to his colored friends, “What would you
do with that man, if you had him on Mill-Creek
bridge?” (a lofty structure by which the railroad crossed
the adjacent stream,) thus hinting at a swift mode of
punishment, and one that might possibly have been a
fatal one.</p>

<p>Though with an unskilled pen, yet have I endeavored
to describe that quiet family among whom the fugitive-slave
law of 1850 fell like a blow. Samuel Wilson had
ample opportunity to study its provisions and its peculiarities
from the newspapers of which I have before
spoken, and from the conversation which these journals
called forth.</p>

<p>This horrible act gave the commissioner before whom
the colored man was tried five dollars only if the man
went free from the tribunal, but ten dollars if he was
sent into slavery. Hitherto, men had suffered in assisting
the fugitive <i>to escape</i>; now it was made a penal
offence to refuse to lend active assistance in apprehending
him.</p>

<p>Friend Wilson had read much of fines and imprisonment,
having studied the sufferings of the people called
Quakers. (Even a lady of so high a standing as she
who became the wife of George Fox was not exempt
from many years’ imprisonment, nor from persecution
at the hands of her own son.) Friend Wilson was
about seventy-five years old when the fugitive-slave bill
was passed. In spite of his advanced years, however,
after sorrowful reflection upon it, he said to one of his
household, “I have made up my mind to go to jail.”</p>

<p>That hospitality and charity which had so long been
the rule of his life he was not now prepared to forego<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
through fear of any penalties which the law would
inflict upon him.</p>

<p>It was while suffering from the infirmities of advanced
years, and from the solicitude which this abominable
enactment had called forth, that Samuel destroyed the
record which he had kept for so many years of the
slaves that had taken refuge with him. This record was
contained in about forty pages of his day-book, and these
he cut out and burned. How would they now be prized
had they not thus been lost!</p>

<p>Samuel Wilson saw, with the prophetic eye of faith
and hope, what he did not live to behold in the flesh,—the
abolition of slavery. His mortal remains repose
beside the Quaker meeting-house where he so long ministered
as an elder. No monumental stone marks that
humble resting-place; but these simple lines of mine,
that portray a character so rare, may serve for an affectionate
memorial.</p>

<p>“Well, Phebe, I guess thee did not expect me this
afternoon. Don’t get up. I will just lay my bonnet in
the bedroom myself. Dinah Paddock told me thy quilt
was in; so I came up as soon as I could. Laid out in
orange-peel! I always did like orange-peel. Dinah’s
was herring-bone; and thine is filled with wool, and
plims up, and shows the works, as mother used to say.
I’ll help thee roll before I sit down. Now then. Days
are long, and we’ll try to do a stroke of work, for thee’s
a branch quilter, I’ve heard say.</p>

<p>“Jethro Mitchell stopped to see me this morning.
They got home from Ohio last week, and he says that
Cousin Jemima Osborne’s very bad with typhoid fever.
Poor Jemima! It had been pretty much through the
family, and after nursing the rest, she was taken down.
I almost know she has no one fit to take care of her,—only
Samuel and the three boys, and maybe some hired
girl that has all the housework to do. The neighbors
will be very kind, to be sure, sitting up nights; but
there’s been so much sickness in that country lately.</p>

<p>“Jemima was Uncle Brown Coffin’s daughter, thee
knows, who used to live down at Sandwich, on the
Cape, when thee and I were girls. She always came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
Nantucket to Quarterly Meeting with Uncle Brown and
Aunt Judith; and folks used to say she wasn’t a bit of
a coof, if she was born on the Cape. When Samuel
and she were married, they asked me and Gorham
Hussey to stand up with them. Jemima looked very
pretty in her lavender silk and round rosy cheeks.
When meeting was over, she whispered to me that there
was a wasp or bee under her neck-handkerchief that had
stung her while she was saying the ceremony. But I
don’t think anybody perceived it, she was so quiet.
Poor dear! I seem to see her now on a sick-bed and a
rolling pillow.</p>

<p>“After my Edward died, I was so much alone that I
thought I couldn’t bear it any longer, and I must just
get up and go to Ohio, as Samuel and ’Mima had often
asked me to. I stopped on the way at Mary Cooper’s
at Beaver, and Mary’s son was joking a little about
Cousin Samuel’s farming, and said he didn’t quite remember
whether it was two or three fences that they
had to climb going from the house to the barn-yard. I
told him that Samuel wasn’t brought up to farming; he
bought land when he moved out West.</p>

<p>“I found Jemima a good deal altered, now that she
had a grown family; but we just began where we left
off,—the same friendliness and kindness. When I was
in Ohio was just when the English Friends, Jonathan
and Hannah Purley, were in the country. We met them
at Marlborough Quarterly Meeting. We were all together
at William Smith’s house,—one of the neatest
of places,—everything like waxwork, with three such
daughters at home. How they worked to entertain
Friends!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“First-day a great many world’s people were at meeting
on account of the strange Friends. Meeting was
very full,—nearly as many out in the yard as in the
house. Very weighty remarks were made by Jonathan
and Hannah. She spoke to my own state:—‘Leave
thy widows and let thy fatherless children trust in Me.’
The meeting was disturbed some by the young babies;
but we could hardly expect the mothers to stay away.</p>

<p>“Second-day was Quarterly Meeting. Of course the
English Friends, being at William Smith’s, drew a great
many others. We had forty to dinner. One of William’s
daughters stayed in the kitchen, one waited on the
table, and one sat down midway, where she could pass
everything and wait on the Friends. It was in the
Eighth Month, and we had a bountiful table of all the
good things of that time of year,—vegetables and fruit
too. William was a nurseryman.</p>

<p>“There was a little disturbance at breakfast, William’s
son—a rather wild young man—making the
young people laugh. We had fish,—mackerel, and little
fresh fish out of the mill-dam. I sat near the middle,
and heard Friend Smith at one end say to each, ‘Will
thee have some of the mackerel, or some of these little
dam-fish?’ Then young William, at the other end,
spoke low to his friends: ‘Will thee have some of the
mackerel, or some of these dam little fish?’ But most
of the young women kept pretty serious countenances.
When Quarterly Meeting was over, the English Friends
went out to Indiana, visiting meetings and Friends’ families,
and I went back with Cousin Samuel’s.</p>

<p>“I was dreadfully disappointed once. One evening
Samuel and ’Mima and the rest of us were sitting round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the table, and Samuel put his hand into his coat-pocket
and drew out the paper and two or three letters. As he
read, I noticed that one of the letters had not been opened,
and caught sight of my name—Priscilla Gardner; so I
put out my hand and took it. It was from sister Mary,—just
as James and she were starting for California.
She told me that they should stay in Pittsburg over one
night, and she hoped I should be able to meet them
there and bid them a long farewell. But when I looked
again at the date of the letter, and glanced at the paper
that Samuel was reading, I found that my letter was
ten days old. The time had gone by. Oh, dear! I
walked out into the kitchen and stood by the stove, in
the dark, and cried. Some one came up behind me. Of
course it was Jemima. She kissed me, and waited for
me to speak. I gave her the letter, and in about ten
minutes I felt able to go back to the sitting-room.
When I sat down, Samuel said, ‘’Mima tells me, Priscilla,
that thee is very much disappointed about thy letter.
I had on this coat when I went to the post-office a
week ago, and I didn’t put it on again till to-day. I
hope thee’ll excuse me. Thomas, my son, will thee
bring us some red-streaks? I feel as if I could eat a
few apples.’</p>

<p>“I felt sorrowful for some time about my sister; but
my mind was diverted when we got word that the
English Friends were coming to our Monthly Meeting
on their way back from Indiana; and as we lived very
near the meeting-house, of course they would be at
Samuel’s. As the time came near, Jemima and I were
a good deal interested to have things nice. They were
going to be at William Smith’s again, where everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
was so neat, and I felt very anxious to make everything
in-doors, at Jemima’s, as nice as we could.</p>

<p>“In the sitting-room was one empty corner, where
the great rocking-chair ought to stand. It was broken,
and put away in the bedroom. I wanted very much to
have it mended; but it seemed as if we could not get it
to Salem. One time the load would be too large, another
the chair would be forgotten. At last one day it was
put in the back of the covered wagon, and fairly started.
When Samuel got home it was rather late in the evening,
and I heard him say to ’Mima, ‘Only think of my
forgetting thy large chair. I was late starting from
home, thee knows; and when I got to Salem there was
a good deal of talk about the war; and when I got halfway
home I remembered the big chair in the back of
the wagon. It can go in next week.’ We did send it
again, but it did not get home before Monthly Meeting.</p>

<p>“Jemima had a very neat home-made carpet on the
sitting-room: she had a great taste for carpets. As there
had been some yards left, she let me cover the front entry
too, and her youngest son Edward, a nice lad, helped me
put it down. A little colored girl, near by, rubbed up
the brass andirons for us, and Edward built up a pile of
wood ready to kindle the fire when it was wanted. A
good many panes of glass had been broken, and as we
had just had an equinoctial storm, some old coats, and
so on, had been stuffed in at several places; but we
managed to get most of the glass put in before Monthly
Meeting.</p>

<p>“When we had done all we could to the house, of
course we began to think of the cooking. Jemima said,
‘I sha’n’t be able to get Mary Pearson to come and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
cook: she is nursing. I wonder whether I hadn’t better
heat the oven on meeting-day. I can get the dinner in
before I go; and then between meetings I can run over
and see to it. I shall hardly be missed. I can slip in
at the side-door of the meeting-house before Mary Ann
has done reading the Minutes.’—‘Then thee will heat
the oven?’ said I.—‘I reckon,’ she said; ‘but it is only
a mud oven. Samuel has been talking for a good while
about having a brick oven. This one is not very safe.’—‘Suppose
I make a little sponge-cake, and put it in
too,’ said I. ‘I’ll send for some sugar, if thee is willing.
Polly Evans used to call me a dabster at sponge-cake.’</p>

<p>“Jemima was willing, and we began to get ready to
go to the store. Edward and the little colored girl
hunted the barn and the straw-shed, and brought in a
quantity of eggs. All could not be sent, because we
needed some at home, and some had been set on, and
some had lain too long. Then Jemima sent to the
garret for brooms and rags, and spared a little butter
too for the store,—not much, to be sure, when Monthly
Meeting was coming. I thought I might as well ride
over with Edward; and when we had got coffee, and
tea, and so on, and were just starting home, I caught
sight of some lemons. I bought a few, and when I got
home asked Jemima if she would not like some lemon-puddings.
‘Thy apple-pies and rice-puddings are nice,
dear,’ I said; ‘but Hannah Purley and Jonathan are
such strangers, we might go a little out of the common
way.’ Jemima smiled at my being so anxious, but
agreed, as she generally did.</p>

<p>“Fourth-day morning we were up very early. Jemima<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
was going to roast some fowls and a loin of veal. Edward
and the little colored girl helped me to beat eggs,
grate lemons, and roll sugar; and everything was ready
for the oven before the Friends came in from a distance,
who always stopped before meeting to get a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“We had a nice little table for them, of course,—dried
beef, preserves, and so on; and one woman Friend, a
single woman, asked for a warm flat-iron to press out
her cap and handkerchief. At last we were ready to
start. Jemima had set everything into the oven, which
stood out in the yard. She put the meats back, and the
cakes and puddings near the door, where it was not so
hot. ‘The door isn’t very safe,’ said she, ‘and I propped
a stick against it to keep it up. Don’t let the dog knock
it down, Susan, while we are gone.’</p>

<p>“The day was beautiful; all signs of the storm over,
except the roads a little muddy; and as we stepped over
to the meeting-house Jemima whispered, ‘I am glad I
told Susan to set both tables. I think we shall have a
good many to dinner. I wanted cole-slaw, like Pennsylvania
folks, but the cows broke in last night and ate
all the solid cabbage.’ She did not talk of these things
generally going into meeting; but our minds were very
full.</p>

<p>“First meeting was rather long, for several Friends
spoke besides the strangers. When it broke, Jemima
stepped out, and I quietly followed her. We walked
over to the house, and round into the side-yard, going
toward the oven. But just as we had got into the yard
we saw the old sow. She had broken out of the barn-yard,
and had been wallowing in a pond of brown water
near the fence. Now she had knocked down Jemima’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
stick, and as the door fell I guess she smelt our good
things, for she had her fore-feet upon the oven floor.
We ran and screamed, but she did not turn. She made
a jump up to the oven, over my cakes and puddings, the
veal and chickens, and carried the oven roof off with her.
Oh, dear! oh, dear! poor Jemima! I could laugh too,
if it wasn’t so dreadful.”</p>

<p><i>Reader.</i>—And what did they do then?</p>

<p><i>Writer.</i>—The best that they could. I do wonder at
Jemima, poor thing, to undertake so much on Monthly
Meeting day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MINERS_OF_SCRANTON">THE MINERS OF SCRANTON.</h2>

</div>

<p>A few years ago I visited Hyde Park,—a mining
division of the youthful city of Scranton. Besides
boarding in the family of an operative, I talked with
citizens, from miners to ministers, and took notes of these
conversations. Upon the information thus obtained the
following article is founded.</p>

<p>There hangs in our house a large map of the State of
Pennsylvania of the year 1851. Scranton is not marked
upon it. A little village named Providence is, indeed,
to be found, which is now an inconsiderable part of consolidated
Scranton. Nine years after the date of this
map, by the census of 1860, the population of Scranton
is given at nine thousand, and in 1870 at thirty-five
thousand. This very rapid increase was caused by the
working of the immense coal-beds which underlie the
narrow valley of the Lackawanna, in which the city is
situated.</p>

<p>Forty-five per cent. of the population is given as foreign,
or fifteen thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven.
The miners are almost all of foreign birth, the Irish
being the most numerous, next the Welsh, then the
Germans, and lastly the English and Scotch. Among
the Welsh-speaking population there are, however, natives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
of Monmouthshire, not now a portion of Wales,
but belonging to England. Among the miners there
are some Pennsylvania Germans. With the exception
of these, there is scarcely to be found at Scranton a
native of this country working underground, either as
miner or laborer.</p>

<p>Gaelic is extensively spoken by the Irish here, there
being women, I am told, newly come over, who do not
speak English. The Welsh language is more extensively
employed. There are seven churches of which
the services are in that language, a Welsh newspaper,
and a literary or scientific society.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But as the Pennsylvania
German employs many English words in speaking
“Dutch,” so does the Welshman introduce many into
his vernacular, as “all right,” “exactly,” “you know,”
“twenty per cent.,” “mortgage,” “explosion,” “universe.”
In speaking English, those from South Wales
treat the letter <i>h</i> as the English do, and speak of Mr.
’Iggins, and of picking ’uckleberries, or say, “That’s a
hodd name,” “I have a hell kitchen to my house.” The
Welshman frequently emphasizes a statement, as, “Yes,
sure,” “Yes indeed, man.” He says, “Dear to goodness!”
“I ’on’t do it, whatever,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Welsh have been accused of bearing malice, and
of being clannish, or of “keeping together.” “I think,”
says a Scotchman, “that that is why they keep up the
Welsh language.” For themselves they claim that they
were never subjugated. They are Republicans almost to
a man, and equally Protestant; lovers of liberty, stubborn
and enduring, not fickle. The Welsh churches at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Scranton belong to the three following sects: Independent
or Congregational, Baptist, and Calvinistic Methodist.</p>

<p>The Welshman is an experienced miner in his own
rugged country. We are informed that the coal-field
of Glamorganshire, in Wales, is one of the most important
mineral districts in the world, and that in this small
district more iron is manufactured than in all the
United States. The Welsh here work more exclusively
at mining than do the Irish and Germans. The
Welshman is the miner, who blasts and takes down the
coal, while the Irishman loads it upon the cars, a certain
number of car-loads forming his daily task.</p>

<p>The Irish are more volatile. They do not practise
much domestic economy; their motto is more, “Come
day, go day.” On a long strike they have generally
nothing laid by for the emergency. A Catholic clergyman
says, “The Irish are not fit for <i>bossing</i>; they
are kept in too much subjection at home.” But the
rule is not without exceptions. I visited a mine of
which the inside foreman was an Irishman, and from
Connaught too, that wild western district. Besides
having attained to this position, he was a landed proprietor,
the owner of a farm. He was more interested
in politics than my Welsh acquaintances, saying that a
friend of his, a miner, could speak as well as any politician.</p>

<p class="tb">The Irish are inclined to superstition. An Irishman
tells me that some years ago a man having been killed
in a mine by the falling of the roof, the story afterward
got round that if persons would go on a moonlight night
to a certain spot—a back road at Scranton—the fairies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
might be met there, and the lost man with them; then
by throwing something, his friends could get him back
all right. Some went there in fun, and some in earnest.</p>

<p>This is like the idea in “the old country” when a
child dies, that the fairies have changed him, leaving
another in his place, and that he might by some means
be recovered. “Some tell it for a fact that they used to
do so in Ireland.”</p>

<p>A Scotchman tells me that if a child, a cow, or a pig
suddenly begins to decline in health, or a cow in milk,
the Irish accuse some one of “looking over it.” They
say that such persons do not know when they do it. This
is doubtless “the evil-eye.”</p>

<p>An Irishwoman was telling us of her son’s losing a
leg, the result of an accident when mule-driving in a
mine. When she learned that the person hurt was her
“Jamesey,” “Oh!” said she, “it was to be. I dreamed
it a year ago.” She told us her dream, but it was very
unlike the circumstance.</p>

<p>Germans, especially Catholics, are said to retain some
of the superstitions of their native country, and to find
“spooks” or spirits. A harmless superstition, if there
be any such, is mentioned of them. They generally
have gardens, and plant things “by the signs.” Beans
planted in the decline of the moon they do not think
will take to the poles.</p>

<p>A German foreman says, “I have sat and listened to
the miners of different nations telling of spooks and
ghosts seen in the mines and other places, but, if one
questions them closely, it is a brother or an uncle who
saw it, and not the man himself.”</p>

<p>The Welsh were formerly very superstitious, but they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
are not so now. Says one, “We do not believe in signs
or omens, or that any flesh can see spirits.” Another
tells me that the belief in hobgoblins, ghosts, witches,
fairies, and all kinds of signs and omens prevailed in
Wales in his childhood, until about thirty years ago a
very eminent Baptist minister, Robert Ellis, brought out
a work called <i>Ofergoelion y Cymry</i> (or Superstitions of
the Welsh), which attracted a great deal of attention,
and had great effect upon the minds of the people in
banishing all these ideas.</p>

<p>In spite of the efforts of their clergy the Irish still
keep up wakes at funerals, watching the body of the
dead. I am told that the friends of the family do not
feel like sleeping, being sorrowful. In the old country
neighbors would gather whether invited or not, and
games would be introduced to keep them awake, but
this custom is not followed here.</p>

<p>A Scotchman says that he thinks the Irish attend
“buryings” better than any other nationality. At
Scranton they impoverish themselves by the train of
carriages hired to attend funerals. “It was a funeral of
fifty carriages;” thus they estimate the honor and glory
of the occasion. But that number was exceeded at the
funeral of a poor Irishwoman at Scranton, when there
were about one hundred and forty “rigs,”—the name
given here to turnouts.</p>

<p>The Welsh do not make such display. A prominent
Welsh citizen, a man of means, apparently wishing to
set an example, hired only one carriage when burying
his son, and walked himself in the funeral procession.</p>

<p class="tb">The chief hardship of the miner is the insecurity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
his life. He is liable to accidents at any moment, either
in blasting the coal, or from the falling of the roof in
the passages and chambers of the mine, or from the
explosion of fire-damp,—carburetted hydrogen gas,—an
extremely explosive substance generated in the mine.</p>

<p>By an awful accident which occurred in the Avondale
mine, more than one hundred men were suffocated below.
At Scranton are interred the remains of about sixty of
these sufferers. The fatal accident is supposed to have
occurred thus. Over each of the mining shafts is erected
a breaker or cracker,—an immense wooden structure,—to
the top of which the loaded cars are drawn up and
then “dumped,” the coal in its gradual downward progress
being sorted, the greater part of it broken, sifted,
and delivered into the cars beneath. The mine at Avondale
was ventilated by means of a furnace or great fire,
causing a draught. From this it is generally supposed
that the breaker took fire, and this in turn set to burning
a great body of coal; and as there was at the Avondale
mine only one way of egress,—that is, up the shaft,—the
men perished below.</p>

<p>At Scranton I saw a sad though simple ballad upon
this disaster:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But all in vain. There was no hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">One single life to save,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there is no second outlet</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the subterraneous cave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No pen can write the awful fright</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And horror that did prevail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among those dying victims</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the mines of Avondale.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Ventilation Act passed by the Legislature of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Pennsylvania after this great disaster forbids the working
of any mine without two outlets. In one that I
visited, instead of a furnace for ventilation, there was
employed an immense fan, worked by a steam-engine,
and supplying sixty thousand feet of pure air per minute.</p>

<p>Great precautions are also taken to prevent the explosion
of fire-damp. Nevertheless, accidents do still occur
from this cause, and, as we have said, from the falling
of the roof, and this although one-third of the coal is left
in for support for the rock above. Some companies will
not insure the lives of miners, and when they do insure
they demand a very high rate,—about like that charged
for those engaged in the manufacture of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Besides the more fearful sufferings to which the miner
is liable, it is not uncommon to see him working in
water, perhaps up to his knees, and at the same time
water may be dropping upon him from above. Sometimes,
on account of powder-smoke from blasting, he
must feel his way rather than see it. Yet it is a general
impression that the miner’s health is good.</p>

<p>It must be accounted one of his hardships that he has
not regular employment. At the time of my visit more
than half the mines were not working at all, and the
rest only on half time.</p>

<p class="tb">The miner’s luxuries are those of other poor men,—his
pipe and glass of ale or beer,—though I must acknowledge
that the Irishman has not dispensed with
whiskey. “I do not think,” says Father ⸺, “that
he drinks more than the Welshman, but perhaps he is
more frequently seen intoxicated in public.” The Welshman,
it has been said, does not drink so much here as at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
home, for he has bidden his native land farewell with
the intention of making money. The use of malt liquors
is very common in this region, and beer is abundant in
the hardest times.</p>

<p>The Irish are fond of singing, dancing, and carousing.
The saloons on Lackawanna Avenue have two rooms,
the front one for drinking, the back for dancing and
general amusement. On the contrary, dancing is generally
considered a heinous sin among the Welsh. Says
a friend, “The ministers denounce balls and dancing
parties as they would manslaughter or murder.”</p>

<p>The German is fond of hunting. He has a gun and
dog, and on a Sunday or other holiday, or when there
is a breakdown in the mine, he goes hunting on the
mountain, and brings home partridges, rabbits, or perchance
a deer. Nor does he have to go far to find his
hunting-ground. The valley of the Lackawanna is only
about two miles wide, and lies in the Moosic Mountains,
a part of the Alleghanies. The Germans are fond, too,
of fishing. Their picnics and musical festivals generally
begin on Saturday afternoon and conclude on Sunday
evening. About two-thirds of the Germans go to
church on Sunday morning, and many visit the beer
gardens in the afternoon with their wives and children.
They observe the church holidays, Good-Friday and
Easter-Monday.</p>

<p>No Irish miners will work on St. Patrick’s Day.
They generally go to church in the morning, and immediately
after service, or about half-past nine, organize
and form processions composed of their various beneficial
societies,—the Father Mathew, St. Mary’s, St. Joseph’s,
Young Men’s Beneficial, etc. They do not have a ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
on St. Patrick’s Day, considering it to be somewhat a
desecration. On the parade day of the Miners’ Union
the different branches frequently have balls in the evening,
and often with a charitable object, as for the relief
of a poor woman whose husband or son has been killed
in the mine. But since the unsatisfactory termination
of the great strike in 1871 the parade day of the
Miners’ Union, August 1, is not generally observed.</p>

<p>Our national holiday, July 4, is kept with great zeal
by the Irish. It is an outlet for the expression of their
animosity to England. In 1874 there was a great
parade of several thousand persons, about two-thirds of
whom were foreigners.</p>

<p>The Welsh have only one national holiday,—St.
David’s Day, March 1. On this day, in Wales, they
form processions and carry the leek, the national emblem.
I saw it growing at Scranton, very much like the onion
when standing. On this day in Wales they also have
meetings for literary pursuits and for vocal music, being
a great singing nation. St. David’s Day is still observed in
some American cities, but among the people at large the
celebration has died out here. Christmas is a great day
among the Welsh, and is observed by meetings of the
<i>Eisteddfod</i>, a very ancient national gathering, which
can be traced back for nine hundred years. The word
means an assembly, and is pronounced <i>Ice-teth-vod</i>, the
<i>dd</i> being like <i>th</i> in <i>thee</i>.</p>

<p>These gatherings are literary and musical. At Hyde
Park it is announced in the Welsh paper, in the spring
of the year, that the Philosophical Society will, at the
ensuing Christmas, give prizes for the best essay or the
best poem on given subjects, and the best piece of original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
music for given words, also for singing and recitation.
But although, as I have stated, these meetings are generally
held on Christmas, yet sometimes a neighboring
town may prefer to fix upon New Year, thus enabling
parties to attend both; and St. David’s Day is sometimes
celebrated by an eisteddfod. From the exercises
of these gatherings women are not excluded. The
eisteddfods are very generally attended by the Welsh,
and are held in some large public hall, the greater part
of the performances being in the Welsh language. Some
of the observances are described to me in simple language
by one who has been a miner. He says that
church choirs attend the eisteddfods, and some very difficult
piece is selected for them to sing, the prize being
about sixty to eighty dollars. Then there are singers
alone, and in parties of three. “They get their poets
there; they meet on Christmas morning about ten, and
adjourn about twelve, and then give out subjects for the
poets,—likely the Lackawanna River, or some subject
they had never thought of before. At two o’clock these
poets will be called upon to recite their verses,—two, perhaps,—and
a small prize is given (about a dollar), principally
for amusement. Again, they call for compositions
in music on some given subject. They must be sent in
beforehand, about two weeks before the eisteddfod, with
the proper name under a seal, the judges being allowed
only to see the fictitious name. Also they read, and the
best reader gets a small prize, the piece being given out
at the meeting where it is read. Another thing causes a
good deal of laughter,—they ask who will volunteer to
sing a musical composition from the notes; some half-dozen
will throw in their names (fictitious), and then one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
will be called out,—perhaps ‘Greenhorn;’ the other five
will retire from the room, while he picks up the difficult
piece, and begins to clear his throat and show his embarrassment,
which is a subject of amusement to the
spectators; then the second comes on, perhaps equally
unskilful; and when all have finished, the remarks of
the judge upon each performance are also very amusing,
the prize being only about fifty cents. In order to avoid
the singers being previously acquainted with the piece,
sometimes a person may be sent out half an hour beforehand
to compose one. The piece chosen is generally one
very difficult to sing. They hold these eisteddfods in
Wales. The Welsh bards have for centuries back been
accustomed to poetry, and so forth. In London they
invited, I think, nearly all the musicians in Europe to
sing on a certain day, all nationalities, for a prize of one
thousand pounds,—a silver cup. There came a choir of
singers from Wales to compete with the best talent they
had in England. The lords and members of Parliament
were there. The English selected some of their most
cultivated people, and the Welsh singers were miners
and men of very little education, and they had to go
from their own country; but they won the prize by a
great distance, and then sang through different towns
and cities in England. There was money raised here in
Hyde Park to support them while they were training,
and to take them up to London.”</p>

<p>A minister at the Welsh Congregational Church in
Hyde Park gave me some explanation of this subject.
He said that a company of musical persons connected
with the Crystal Palace offered a prize for competition
for vocal choirs, the reward being a silver cup worth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
one thousand pounds. In 1872 a choir of five hundred
persons from South Wales, called the South Wales
Choral Union, men, women, and children, principally
miners and their children, appeared, and took the prize
without competition. The next year, 1873, a trained
band of English musicians, three hundred and fifty in
number, appeared to compete for the prize, but without
success, for the Welsh won it again. The English were
from London, and were called the Tonic Sol Fa Association.</p>

<p>I heard nothing at Scranton, however, of the harp,
once thought indispensable to the bards, two men on
the street at Hyde Park, with pipe and bagpipe, being
the only peculiar instrumental performers that I remember.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that so dangerous a pursuit as
mining, with the horror of beholding accidents sometimes
mortal, the uncertainty of obtaining regular employment,
and, more than any of these, the working so
far from the excellent light of the sun, would repress
the buoyant spirits of the Irishman; but, says my Connaught
acquaintance, “Working in the mines does not
dull an Irishman’s spirits,—not a bit of it.”</p>

<p>A German also says that he does not think that working
in the mines makes the Irish and others less fond
of jokes, for they get together more. The mine is
cool in summer and warm in winter, and if there is
a lull, from want of cars or other cause, the men will
squat down, miner fashion, and tell stories and crack
jokes.</p>

<p>On a like occasion the little blackened slate-pickers
swarm out of the cracker, like children let loose from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
school or like bees from the hive, and play at boyish
games. Sometimes they get hold of an empty truck car,
and ride down grade full speed, having the labor afterward
of getting the car up again. When a loaded car is
coming up the shaft, they can hear the warning whistle
of the steam-engine, for soon the coal will be running
down the chutes, and their labors recommence.</p>

<p>When the circus comes to town there is danger of a
stampede among the boys who drive mules and perform
like labors. They will come to the mine in the morning
and gather together, and unless the “boss” is on the
watch, they may be off in a body, and all work be at an
end for the day, as the men cannot get on without them.
On the contrary, if they are separated and started at
their work, they will stay. But even the little fellows
lately spoken of, “the boys in the cracker,” who pick
the slaty refuse from the coal, have been known thus to
stop mining operations.</p>

<p>The Welsh are not a humorous and jocose people like
the Irish, though I am told that they are inclined to
mirth when speaking together in their own language. A
faint smile was caused at the Congregational church by
a remark of the preacher. Translated, it amounts to
this: “Some men drink a quantity of beer, which does
not affect the brain, as they have so little brains;” and
the application seems to have been that in a like manner
the trials and vicissitudes of life affect some men little,
as they have but little sensibility.</p>

<p>I am told that among the works of the Welsh poets
are many epigrammatic stanzas. Of one of these, an
epitaph, I received the following prose version: “In
this life she told all the untruth that she could. Be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
careful not to wake her: if you do, she will say that she
has been to heaven.”</p>

<p>The late hours which have been kept by our “Pennsylvania
Dutch” when <i>Fanny has a beau once</i> do not
prevail among the Welsh at Scranton. A gentleman
who leads a large church choir, of which all the men
are miners, and not half of these church members,
tells me that the young men wait upon the young women
home before nine, chat a while on the front porch or
steps, and generally leave at ten.</p>

<p>A physician says that most of the courtship of the
Welsh is begun, and often finished, while walking the
streets after church. “This street is thronged,” says he,
“on Sunday nights in summer. At first the young men
walk behind, but after a while one step is quickened or
the other slackened, or both, and they come together,
and form lively parties, until ten or after. Courtships
are brief, and the marriages early and happy.”</p>

<p>I asked a Welsh acquaintance whether his son married
young. “No, he didn’t marry young; he was
twenty-three.” Says another, “Young women among
the Welsh miners marry from eighteen to twenty-two.
At the latter age they are joked about being old maids.”</p>

<p class="tb">Miners’ wives generally hold the purse. As soon as
he gets his pay and his fill of beer, the miner hands his
wages to his wife, who acts as treasurer with much discretion,
making all the purchases of the house and transacting
the business of the family. A miner’s wife said
to me, “My husband is a good workman. He never
lost any time by drinking or anything like that. I
nearly supported the family by my own sewing and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
taking boarders. Ever since I have been married I
tried to keep our own table, and could generally do it
unless I was sick. I ’most always had a good deal of
my own way, but I always consulted him. He always
gave me his wages. I think when a man gives his wife
his wages she feels more interest. I’d kick up a big
fuss if he did not give me his wages. Whenever he was
going away, I’d remind him, ‘Charley, haven’t you got
any money in your pocket?’ He knew where the money
was, you know? We always had one purse. My purse
was his, and his was mine. We have always lived in
good unity together.</p>

<p>“This is not always the way with miners. We have
a neighbor who must always go to the office on pay-day
to get her husband’s money. He’ll go and take the pay,
and hand it over to her. She says he always gives it to
her. If she did not go and get it, he’d go to the saloon
and spend it. It looks to me as if a man was so weak-minded,
to do the like of that!”</p>

<p>The Welsh boys, too, hand their wages over to their
mother. Germans, on the contrary, do not give their
pay to the feminine head of the family; and, alas! a
physician says that Germans are the best pay.</p>

<p>The Welsh woman is ambitious for her husband’s
shoes to shine, and on every Saturday evening she
blacks the shoes of the family (all set in a row), until
the girls are old enough to relieve her. Another corrects
this statement, saying that by the old Welsh rule
Monday is the day for cleaning and putting away the
Sunday’s shoes.</p>

<p>Mrs. ⸺ says that she sets a tub of warm water for
her son when he comes home from picking slate at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
mine, and gives him soap and a woollen cloth, that he
may “wash all over.” To bathe in this manner is
almost a universal rule with the men on leaving the
mine, and a physician says that he considers the daily
bath beneficial to their health. Says an acquaintance,
“Many think, ‘I would not have miners to sleep in my
beds, they look so black and dirty.’ But there is scarcely
one in five hundred that does not wash all over when
he comes home from his work; the general rule is, before
he eats his supper. He washes his head, and puts
on his clean clothes, and looks more like a clerk in a
store than a miner.”</p>

<p>When first I attended a Welsh church at Scranton, I
was surprised at the nice appearance of the congregation,
and I afterward inquired whether there were any miners
there. But on my late visit I learned an almost invariable
means of discovering who have worked in the
coal mines. On the back of my host’s hands were many
blue spots, looking like faint tattooing. These were
marks where he had been cut by the coal. Miners frequently
have one or more of these blue scars upon the
face. The coal-dust doubtless remains in the wounded
place, like Indian ink in tattooing; and by these marks
you can perceive that men have been miners, though
their occupation now be quite different.</p>

<p>The Welsh have three suits of clothes, one for work,
one for evening, and another for Sunday. Their children
look very neat when going to church or Sunday-school.
The Irish mother, too, loves to see her children
look fine on these occasions, but she does not show so
much taste. Both are much attached to their churches and
Sunday-schools. The Germans are not so devotional.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>The education of miners’ sons is often much neglected.
The law does not permit them to enter the public schools
before the age of six; and although the Ventilation Act
prevents children from working within the mines under
twelve, yet no such prohibition exists as regards the
breaker, or “cracker,” above the mine. A superintendent
says, “I have had them to come at six, and their
mothers with them, to get them taken on.”</p>

<p>Most of the recent Welsh emigrants, and those who
are still poor and have large families, send their boys to
work at the mine. But very few that have been in this
country ten years are so poor as to be obliged to send
them at an early age. We except those of dissipated
habits, who spend their money in the saloons.</p>

<p>A German tells me that the children of German
miners are generally sent to school, but so great is the
demand for boys to pick slate in the breaker, that they
generally go there at about eight or ten. Boys’ wages
in the breaker begin at thirty-five cents per day, and go
up to seventy-five or eighty-five. A mule-driver gets
from seventy-five cents to a dollar. Even the little boys
in the breakers are proud to receive their month’s wages,
not to spend themselves, but to take home.</p>

<p>A friend says that as soon as the boy earns fifty cents
at the mine, his sole ambition is to earn seventy-five,
and then to be a driver. From driving one mule his
desire is to drive a team, then to become a laborer, and
then a full miner. To be a “boss,” or superintendent,
is a distant object of ambition, like being President—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alps on Alps arise.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Almost every one has to work for some time as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
laborer, loading coal, before he becomes a full miner.
The sons of miners generally follow in their fathers’
footsteps; but those who have been here many years
often look higher for their boys, and give them trades.
I met a lawyer, an intelligent young man, whose father
is a miner.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the boys in the mines here, the
Catholic Church has organized night schools, open during
the six colder months of the year. The boys, if
able, pay from twenty-five to fifty cents a month. A
Catholic clergyman estimates that over two-thirds of the
boys attend these schools. As a general thing, the use
of the public school buildings has been granted them,
but the rooms are often overcrowded. Though principally
organized by the Catholic Church, none are refused
on account of their belief. But after working all day,
the boy cannot bring so much animation to the night-school
as if he were not fatigued. The girls have better
opportunities, but they are often put out to domestic
service at twelve or fourteen.</p>

<p class="tb">The fare of the miner is from necessity simple, not
luxurious. He breakfasts at about five or six o’clock on
bread, butter, and tea. In a little tin can he carries his
dinner of bread and cheese, perhaps with the addition of
a bit of pie or cake, and in a tin bottle cold tea without
milk. Even this simple luxury is sometimes discarded,
and water taken in its place. The miner proper finishes
his work about four o’clock, and finds his best meal at
home, often a “good cooked meal” of meat, potatoes,
etc. We may call this dinner, and the former meal
lunch. A miner tells me, however, that he has often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
brought his food uneaten out of the mine from want of
time; for he must have his car loaded when the driver
comes for it, or lose one of the seven car-loads which
form his daily work.</p>

<p>It is the Welshman who eats bread and cheese. His
companion or laborer is generally Irish. He is detained
longer in the mine, and wants meat for his noonday
meal. Late in the fall, if the Irishman has not a pig,
he generally buys from the country farmer a part of a
beef, which he salts. Fresh meat from the stalls is too
dear for him. When his beef runs out, he buys mess
pork from the store; but I fear that he is not always
able to take his bit of meat to the mine. Rather than
cheese, he will take a couple of boiled eggs, for he is very
fond of what he calls “a fresh egg.” He carries milk in
preference to tea, and he loves to own a cow. Cows are
often seen pasturing upon the commons or the unfenced
land belonging to the companies, the surface of which
is not yet sold for building-lots. The Irishman is very
fond of keeping geese and ducks. When he has a lot,
he raises potatoes and cabbage, for here, or at home, he
dearly loves cabbage with his boiled bacon.</p>

<p>The German takes for his lunch bread and butter, and
perhaps a “chunk of sausage,” and piece of pie or cake.
His tin bottle holds coffee. The miner’s dinner-kettle
and bottle are slung on a rope over one shoulder, and
on entering the passages of the mine are hung on one of
the props that support the roof. The men often play
jokes on each other by stealing pie or cake. Of course,
the German makes sauer-kraut. He keeps pigs, and
sometimes buys a quarter of beef, which he smokes.</p>

<p>Great simplicity in food seems to exist among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
mining people in Wales, where it is said that they never
think of eating butter and cheese at once; they would
think it sinful. Mr. E⸺, of Scranton, says that he
offered cold meat to an old Welsh lady who was visiting
him, and she thanked him, but she had bread and butter.
And Mr. J⸺, of Welsh birth, a miner from fourteen
years to forty-six, tells me that if the streets were lined
with meat, he could not eat it oftener than once a day,
though he admits that he sometimes takes an egg or two
for breakfast.</p>

<p>The Welsh miners who come to this country almost
invariably bring one or two feather-beds. The German
who can afford it sleeps in cold weather on one feather-bed
and under another; if he cannot, he sleeps on straw
and under feathers.</p>

<p>At his work the miner generally wears a woollen shirt,
pantaloons of bed-ticking or stout linen, and heavy boots.
I have seen the sole studded with iron lest the coal should
cut the leather.</p>

<p>As to the number of miners who own their houses, I
have heard various estimates for Scranton, as from one-third
upward, the highest estimate being in one district
seven out of ten of the married.</p>

<p>The German’s house is a good one, painted or whitewashed.
Germans cultivate flowers and vegetable gardens,
principally worked by the women, who carry
produce in baskets for sale. The Welshman, too, when
he has a home, has a comfortable one, looking quite
pretty with its surroundings. But though the Irish
often own their homes, these are of a ruder kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p class="tb">Has the miner aspirations? This question has been
put, and I have been tempted to reply by another, Is
he a man? Mr. L⸺, of Scranton, came to this
country when about twenty. He worked a few months
at Carbondale, in this Lackawanna region, and afterward
in Ohio, mining bituminous coal by the bushel,—one
hundred and twenty bushels a day, at two cents each.
Here he laid by one hundred and thirty dollars, which
he sent to Wales to bring his parents over. “I was,”
said he, “the only son they ever ’ad.” At twenty-five
he married, and soon after took a contract in a mine in
Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Here the failure of
his employer threw him into debt, from which he was
not clear until about thirty. He took contracts on coal
slopes, working always as a miner himself, but hiring
hands to help him. For twenty years he was a foreman,
a foreman’s salary averaging twelve hundred dollars.
He also went to California, and mined gold to profit.
He bought, too, a farm in Pennsylvania for three thousand
five hundred dollars, and tried farming himself for
two years, but found it harder work than mining.</p>

<p>“Some eight of us,” he says, “all miners, bought some
years ago about five and a half acres of ground here for
eight thousand and fifty dollars. We sold it out in building-lots,
in about two months, for nearly the cost, and
retained the mineral, which we value at twenty thousand
dollars.” By mineral is meant, of course, the coal, of
which several valuable veins underlie Scranton at the
point alluded to.</p>

<p>Mr. L⸺ continues: “Another company of us, all
miners and all poor men originally, have bought a tract
of four thousand acres of coal lands near the centre of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
Alabama. I have been down twice to see it.” He
has now retired from active business, and lives in a neat
house surrounded by a large garden, which he cultivates
with pleasure and profit.</p>

<p>Another instance of success in a more intellectual field
is Mr. ⸺, editor of a Welsh paper. When he was
eight years old his mother was left a widow, with nine
children, from three years of age to sixteen, and with
nothing but a few household goods. By putting her
children to work early at the mines she kept her family
together. She herself spoke nothing but Welsh. Mr.
⸺ was a precocious laborer, if I may use the expression,
he being well grown, and becoming a driver at
ten years, and a miner at sixteen. He never had but
thirty-two days’ schooling; but having great delight in
books, he got a Daboll’s Arithmetic, and went through it
twice, and found some one to set him copies for writing,
making use afterward of copper-plates. One great advantage
which he had was the leisure which the miner
often enjoys. He says, “When I was working at Carbondale
two years, I could generally get my day’s work
done by noon. When a miner, I wrote essays three times
for the eisteddfod, and two of them drew prizes. These
were each twenty-five dollars; but the pecuniary reward
was not what we aimed at,—it was the honor. I gave up
mining in 1869, and have been connected with a newspaper
ever since.”</p>

<p>The miner occasionally attains to great wealth. Such,
at least, was the case of Richard Care, of Minersville, of
whom I hear that he came to this country a poor man,
and died worth a million and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p class="tb">But all these cases are exceptional. The chief ambition
of the miners in general is plenty of work and good
wages. “They’re death on the wages,” says one, “as
the last suspension showed.” As to their desiring to
improve their condition, a German tells me that there is
always such a desire among his people. “I can take
you up,” says he, “to Elmira, New York, and show
you, I guess, a whole township of farmers who have
been miners. The Germans who work here are very
rarely from the mining districts of Germany, but from
the agricultural. The German will take his boys into
the mine to lay up a little capital, and having done this,
he will buy a farm, or go into merchandise, or open a
saloon.”</p>

<p>What provision has the miner for times when he is
out of work?</p>

<p>I might answer after the manner of another,—credit,
credit, credit. The miner is paid monthly, but by the
smaller companies not always so often. Could he once
tide over the first month, and enter upon the cash system,
he might be pecuniarily benefited by the change,
but he seems wedded to the credit system. Should any
trader advertise that he would sell goods for cash twenty
per cent. lower, I am told that the other store-keepers
would throw their influence against him, and also that
several cash stores have been tried in Scranton that did
not succeed in the long-run. One of the main provisions
against misfortune is the Beneficial Society. The miners
do not, however, often join the Freemasons. Many of
the Welsh belong to the following societies: Odd-Fellows,
Foresters (a secret society of foreign origin), Ivorites
(named for Ivor Hael, the Welsh founder), Red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Men, and the “Philanthropic Institution.” There are
other societies, Irish and German. As for the miner
who does not belong to any of these, and who has no
other means, if he meets with a serious accident or a
protracted illness, he must go to the poor-house; but if
I may credit good authority, he very rarely goes there.</p>

<p>Father ⸺ says, “We need hardly use the word
poor-house here, for I never knew a miner to get there.
The Irish have a horror of it; but occasionally some
aged, dependent person goes. The law here forbids out-door
support for the poor.” A young lawyer says, “No
Welsh miner ever goes to the poor-house. He has a son
or daughter, a brother or sister, a nephew or niece, who
will not intrust him to the cold charities of the public.
If his wife is industrious, she and the children can take
care of him.” Mr. L⸺ says, “Very seldom does a
miner get to the poor-house, unless he be a drunkard;
for if he be sober, his fellow-workmen in the mine, in
case of accident or long sickness, make a collection for
him.” And Dr. H⸺ says, “A kinder set of men
never walked the earth. When one of them meets with
an accident in the mine, the men put in their hands and
raise a little purse for him. They will divide their last
dollar with a wounded comrade. The Irish extend
their care to the widow of their unfortunate companion,
whom they frequently set up in a little saloon, where
she vends candy, pea-nuts, and various drinks.” Since,
however, the beneficial societies have become popular,
there is not so much need of resorting to succor by subscription.</p>

<p>When urged to insure his life, the reply of the Irishman
almost invariably is, “What do I want to insure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
my life for my wife for? When I am dead, I don’t
want another man to spend my money.”</p>

<p>In these dull times, when so many were out of work,
I frequently saw quoit-pitching, which seemed to be a
favorite amusement; some leap and some play marbles
with the boys; but neither men nor boys spend their
time in play. Some work for farmers, some pick berries,
some “fuss about their gardens,” or one, perhaps,
has a sickly wife, and will stay at home and help. A
young Cornish man whom I met was going to haul stone
to build an addition to his house. I visited a young
Scotchman, a foreman, who was employing himself in
another manner. In the middle of his sitting-room stood
a surveyor’s compass upon its high tripod, and upon the
table lay a book,—<i>A Conversation on Mines</i>, by William
Hopton: Manchester and London. I said to him that
he was differently situated from other miners, because he
was interested in books, and could study in an idle time
like the present. He replied that it was the fault of the
others if they did not want to read and study; he had
never heard of any one in any profession who could say
that he had become perfect, and in his own case the more
he learned, the more he found that there was to learn.</p>

<p class="tb">Among the Welsh, however, I learn that there is considerable
culture besides that of which I have already
spoken. In the Welsh Baptist church at Hyde Park a
society meets once a week for reading and debating.
They read the Bible and discuss its history and geography,
for six months reading the Old Testament, and for
six the New. In reading the Book of Samuel, the
question arose, “Did the witch of Endor raise Samuel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
from the dead?” After some discussion the debate was
found to take up too much time, and it was referred to
disputants, two upon each side. The question brought
up spiritualism, in which very few of the Welsh believe,
but they love to discuss subjects of general interest.
After an evening’s debate, the chairman put the question,
and it was decided that Samuel was not raised.
With this decision the preacher does not agree.</p>

<p>About six years ago the same society argued the question
whether the world was created in six days, and decided
that the days were not periods of twenty-four
hours. After the decision, they had a lecture upon
geology from a former preacher, in which he took the
same view.</p>

<p>The Welsh, without sectarian distinction, support the
Philosophical Society at Hyde Park, its proceedings
being in the Welsh language, and its meetings held
every Saturday for eight months in the year. By
voluntary contribution they are establishing a free
library. Some of the Welsh miners also have considerable
private libraries, of three hundred volumes
and over.</p>

<p>The miners in this region are generally peaceable.
Order is preserved in the mines by very strict rules. If
one man strikes another, he is immediately discharged.
If one insults another, the latter is to complain to the
foreman, who acts as justice of the peace, and reports
difficult cases to the general superintendent. Properly
speaking, however, there are two foremen to a mine,
one above and one below. On an average, there are
about one hundred and fifty hands employed at each
mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>Even in idle times there is very little disorderly conduct.
“The men,” says R⸺, “will sometimes get
tight, two or three of them, but as for getting up big
rows, there is nothing of it. In the time of the great
suspension there were threats of burning some buildings
belonging to the Lackawanna Coal and Iron Company,
and I went to guard one of them; but we never saw
anybody.”</p>

<p>To this general good order, however, there seems to
be a notable exception. One evening my landlady sent
her son to escort me with a lantern, the lamps along
a principal street being “smashed.” They had been
broken, it appeared, for some time. I asked the boy
why there was not a reward offered for the discovery of
the persons who had done it. “Oh,” said he, “the
Molly Maguires will kill men!”</p>

<p>The Molly Maguires are the “Ancient Order of Hibernians,”
of whose doings in the coal regions dreadful
stories have been told. Although when I was at Scranton
it was said that the priests had broken up the society,
yet I saw, one Sunday, members of the “ancient order”
in handsome green and white or silver regalia, who
seemed prepared to take part, with many other persons,
in laying the corner-stone of a church near Scranton.
Hence I inferred that the clergy had not broken up the
society, but might have obliged them to give up their
pledge of secrecy. After I left Scranton, however, a
man was killed in that region, of whose murder I understand
that the Molly Maguires were suspected. But
so great at one time was the fear of the people at large
of the Mollies, that two hundred or more revolvers were
sold in one day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>There remains to be considered a subject of more general
public interest than perhaps any other in which the
miner is concerned, namely, strikes. “Suspension” is the
genteel name among the men. In 1870 a great strike
occurred here, which finally involved not only the whole
of the anthracite, but a part of the bituminous region of
Pennsylvania, which lasted near six months, bringing
coal to an immense price in the market, and seriously
embarrassing business, and which deserves the name of
the great suspension. To make the matter perfectly
clear, it is worth while to revert to the opening of our
civil war in the year 1861.</p>

<p>The standard price paid to the miner in July, 1874,
was ninety-three cents per car-load. At this rate he could
make about three dollars and fifty cents per day for himself,
and pay his assistant or laborer about two dollars
and thirty-five cents. But before the breaking out of
the rebellion the price of mining was as low as forty-five
cents per car, or less than half the price in 1874.</p>

<p>During the war so great was the demand for iron, and
consequently for coal, that prices had risen by 1864 to
one dollar and sixty-eight cents per car, not very far
from double the present price, but payable, as it will be
remembered, in greatly depreciated paper money. In
spite of this fact, this was the miners’ flush time. I
have been told that many were earning from one hundred
and fifty to five hundred dollars a month, and that
some of these bought homes, and afterward increased
their landed property.</p>

<p>The manner in which this great advance in wages
was obtained is especially worthy of note. The Miners’
Union, or Working-Men’s Beneficial Association,—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
W. B. A.,—began here, during the war, among the employés
of the three great mining companies, the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company; the
Delaware and Hudson Canal Company; and the Pennsylvania
Coal Company. At the time the W. B. A. was
organized, coal was rising in price, but the companies
were not raising the men’s wages. The miners felt themselves
entitled to a share, the tenth or twelfth part of the
advanced price, but they did not receive it until they
called a convention. This, as I understand, was thus
organized: The hands in each mine formed a branch of
the W. B. A., and each branch was entitled to send two
delegates to local conventions, and these in their turn
appointed delegates to a general convention when one
was held.</p>

<p>In order to obtain an advance in wages, the men appointed
at their conventions committees to wait upon the
general agent of each company, and to make the same
demand upon the same day, and it was always granted,
until the price had risen, as I have already stated, in
1864, to one dollar and sixty-eight cents, its greatest
height. In September of that year, when the war was
drawing to a close, and the price of coal had begun to
decline, the wages of the miners were reduced eight and
a half per cent., without causing any disturbance. By
July of 1865 gradual reductions had brought wages
down from one dollar and sixty-eight cents per car-load
to one dollar and nine cents. On this decline there was
a strike among the miners in the Scranton and Wilkesbarre
region.</p>

<p>In the preceding May a convention had been called at
Scranton to take action on the fall in wages. Many were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
opposed to striking. But in July another convention
was called, and on the 15th the hands of the three great
companies struck, from Wilkesbarre to Carbondale, and
“stayed out” eleven weeks. The companies did not
raise their wages before they resumed work, but they
began again with the understanding that their pay
would be raised, and an advance of five cents per car-load
was made in a few days, bringing the price up
to one dollar and fourteen cents.</p>

<p>After this the men were quiet for over three years,
but as wages declined, by January, 1869, great discontent
was felt among the miners. There was no outbreak,
however, until April, when the men of the two greatest
mining companies suspended. These companies, the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western; and the Delaware
and Hudson, when in full operation, sent at that time
one hundred and eighteen thousand tons of coal weekly
to market. The withdrawal of a mass like this must,
of course, influence the price, and the Pennsylvania
Coal Company (the third in size here, and employing
about one-sixth of the hands) profited by the withdrawal
of the other companies, and, figuratively speaking, made
hay while the sun shone. The Miners’ Union could
not have been strong then, or the men of this company
would not have worked while the others were out. It
has been remarked that while prices continued to rise,
the miners were delighted with the Union, but when
wages began to fall, their interest in it fell too. However
this may have been, the Pennsylvania Coal Company,
in the strike of 1869, continued to work, and
raised the men’s wages about once a month, until they
amounted to one dollar and thirty-one cents the car-load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>The two other companies probably tired, if corporations
can be said to tire, of seeing the Pennsylvania
Coal Company carrying on business thus, and it seems
that hints were conveyed to the outstanding men by
agents of their employers that they had made no organized
application to the companies, informing them of
their wishes. At length committees from the men called
upon the agents of the companies, and offered to go to
work at the rate at which the other men were working.
To these the agents answered, “We are always ready to
pay what our neighbors are paying;” and the men went
to work at one dollar and thirty-one cents. This was
not a long-protracted strike, and the men were successful
in obtaining nearly all which they demanded.</p>

<p>These good prices continued for over a year, partly
it seems, for a reason to me unexplained, and in part
because the price at which the men went to work, although
a high one, was actually not so high as the companies
could then afford to pay, so greatly was the stock
of coal reduced and the market-price raised.</p>

<p>Wages continued then at one dollar and thirty-one
cents, when, in November, 1870, the three companies
united in notifying the men that in one month there
would be a reduction to eighty-six cents. This decline
was an immense one, over thirty per cent., and the news
came upon the miners like a thunderbolt. It would
have been much better policy for the employers to reduce
the price gradually as coal declined in market.</p>

<p>This state of things may indicate that there is not
much sympathy between the miners and the corporations,
and I am told that the men feel bitter toward their employers
from their showing so little respect for their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
manhood as not to be willing to consult with them.
These are tender points with some in the Scranton region.
You will find the foremen not very anxious to
talk about them, but you will be able to obtain the
admission from some here that the men feel their interest
to be at variance with their employers’.</p>

<p>When the end of the month of notification arrived,
the men declined to take the sum offered, and suspended.
They claimed that the matter of wages should be determined
by a sliding-scale, adjusted to the price of coal
in the market, and this they called a basis. They also
desired to have an agent to examine the books of the
companies, and to see what their profits really were.
The first demand is so reasonable that we can scarcely
see why it should be refused, and it is granted in the
Schuylkill County region.</p>

<p>This sliding-scale, or the basis, became a rallying-cry
during the long and trying conflict which followed. And
they stuck to this until they were starved out.</p>

<p>On their side, the companies thought that strikes were
coming too often (the interval having been about sixteen
or eighteen months); and now, as we have said, the three
companies were united.</p>

<p>The miners, however, had not all been in favor of
suspending work. Some of the leading Welshmen would
have preferred to compromise by offering to go on at a
reduction less than that demanded by the companies, but
these were overborne by others, who were very violent
in the meetings of the W. B. A., crying out, “Strike!
strike!” until, I was told, it was as much as a man’s
life was worth to oppose them. So the pacific or conservative
Welshmen were outvoted by the more reckless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
of their own nation and the rest. But once engaged, the
Welsh were the most determined, being unwilling to
yield until they had effected something. Says one, “I
believe they would have held out to this day;” and
another, “I believe they would have emigrated: they
had strong talk of going out West in squads.” As it
happened, if we may call it chance, the only blood shed
in the struggle was that of two Welshmen.</p>

<p>The Miners’ Union did not anticipate that the companies
would hold out as long as they did; but they
seem to have been firmly banded, like the men, and they
had the power of capital on their side. “It was like a
big war,” says an acquaintance,—“a six months’ war.”</p>

<p>It seems to the writer that in this contest, however,
the men were struggling against fate; for as paper
money advanced in value and approached to gold, so, as
a general rule, must the price of everything decline that
was paid for in that paper money, including wages, the
price of labor.</p>

<p>The men were not literally starved out, it seems; for
one interested says, “I heard of no miners that were
suffering for provisions, though some of them were
pretty hard up. The store-keepers took the miners’
side, because it was their interest to do so. The bigger
pay the miner got, the more he had to spend in the
stores.”</p>

<p>Of course the time must have come when the tradesmen
could no longer give credit, and we readily infer
that that point must have been nearly or entirely reached
when the men had been out near six months.</p>

<p>During this period families were, of course, much
restricted. They could probably get along with no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
new clothing, or but little; and the store-keepers trusted
them for flour, tea, sugar, tobacco, and the other little
<i>necessaries</i> of life. Such, too, as had lots, could raise
potatoes, cabbage, etc., but some of them became deeply
involved in debt.</p>

<p>However, the times had been so good that probably
at least half the men had means to support themselves
for a little time, and they grasped at any work they
could find anywhere. As the strike began in December,
however, the amount of work must have been small.
Had not the other anthracite regions become involved,
their comrades might have sent them funds, or given
them a share of work; but this was impossible. The
funds of the Miners’ Union, the W. B. A., were very
small. They were unable to support the men in such a
time. Nor were they supported by the public. Says a
friend, “Not one miner in this region went to the poor-house,
nor do I believe that one applied to the commissioners
of the poor for out-door assistance. They
would not have thought of such a thing, for they believed
that the sympathies of the commissioners were with their
employers.”</p>

<p>About once a month a committee would call upon Mr.
⸺, the agent of the ⸺ Company (and doubtless
upon the agents of the others also) and inquire whether
the company would grant them a basis on the former
prices, but they effected nothing.</p>

<p>The Irishmen were poorer, and they were sooner
ready to yield. At length a gentleman of Scranton induced
thirty men to “break away from the Union,” and
to go to work in a mine belonging to a company smaller
than the three mentioned. These men were almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
Irish. They went to work daily about seven in
the morning, returning about five in the evening, carrying
arms, and were accompanied by soldiers, and led by
their employer.</p>

<p>When the news spread among the miners that a body
of men had gone to work in a certain spot, the miners
would gather upon the way to see who these were, and
the on-looking crowd was swelled by boys, and perhaps
by women. As the men who had yielded made their
appearance, the cry arose among the spectators, “Here
come the blacklegs!”—<i>i.e.</i>, the turncoats or traitors.
One evening as these men were thus returning along
the street in Hyde Park, it is said that a boy on the
street threw a stone. One of the men attacked turned
round, and, discharging his musket, shot two men
through the body with the same ball, and killed them
instantly.</p>

<p>At least one of these men was a miner, and was or
had been a Methodist local preacher; the other was going
to get medicine for a sick child. Both were Welshmen.
There was immediately an immense excitement.
While the man who fired the shot was being taken to
the magistrates, some one cried out, “Kill him!” but
others waved them back, saying, “Let the law do him
justice.”</p>

<p>The magistrate, a Welshman, committed him to jail
at Wilkesbarre, whence he was bailed out, and when
brought to trial was defended by the companies, was
acquitted, and lives peaceably in the neighborhood now.
I tell the tale as it was told to me.</p>

<p>So the men gave in. This bloody scene and the ensuing
funerals probably broke the doughty spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
Welshmen. They gave in and went to work in the
latter part of May, not entirely six months from the
outbreak of the contest. They began at eighty-six
cents, the price which the companies had fixed; but on
the 1st of June their pay was raised to ninety-three
cents.</p>

<p>Can strikes be prevented? In speaking to a miner
about the great suspension, I asked whether it would not
be better for the company and the men to meet and settle
these matters.</p>

<p>“It could not be done,” he answered. The miners
do not seem to have any desire to buy into the stock
of the companies. Is it for fear that, as a miner’s
wife said, “the big fishes would eat the little fishes
up?”</p>

<p>But if the miner does not thus co-operate with his
employers, or in the manner that the poorest sailor on a
whaling vessel once did with the owners, the principle
of joint-stock is not unknown to them. An intelligent
man, once a miner, tells me that all working men are
now aspiring to form co-operative associations for the
purpose of carrying on mining and iron-works themselves.
There are iron-mills on this system, he said, at
Danville, and a number of furnaces and rolling-mills in
Ohio. These are on the same plan as the renowned
works at Rochdale, England, that have been in successful
operation for many years.</p>

<p>There is, too, a co-operative store at Hyde Park,
Scranton. This store has been in operation for several
years, and pays stockholders from twelve to fifteen per
cent. on stock and purchase. The majority of the stockholders
are Welsh, and nearly all are miners.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IRISH_FARMERS">IRISH FARMERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>In 1881 I spent four weeks in Ireland, principally in
the south, in the county Cork. Desiring to learn the
condition of the farmer who himself follows the plough,
I inquired among various classes of people. I boarded
four days with a farmer, and about as long at a castle;
down in the southwest I talked with a citizen who had
been boycotted; travelling third-class on railways, I
conversed with other passengers; in Dublin with fellow-boarders;
in London with a prominent Irish politician.
Of these interviews I took notes, so that I am not
obliged to depend alone on memory for my simple story.
I try to give conversations, but must allow the reader to
draw inferences.</p>

<p>For many years I have known farmers living in comfort
and accumulating property by the labor of their own
hands upon their own soil. Such are Quaker farmers
in Chester County and “Pennsylvania Dutch” in Lancaster.
In Ireland I wished to visit a similar class.
But I found no one who owns the land he ploughs, or
ploughs that which he owns.</p>

<p>I was assured in Philadelphia by persons knowing
Ireland that I could not find the house of a working
farmer in which I would be willing to live. This discouraged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
me, but by means of introductions from two or
three young women hying at domestic service, I obtained
a good opening into the land. One gave me a
letter to her confessor in Cork, whom we will call the
“Riverend Lawrence O’Byrne.” I found him intelligent
and genial; in person rather tall and thin but with
a color in his cheek. He was at a loss to recommend me
to any working farmer’s house, saying that I should live
on potatoes and skimmed milk; but I thought that I
could live so for some days if those people did all their
lives.</p>

<p>In further conversation, Mr. O’Byrne lamented the
degradation caused by liquor, and declared that the bulk
of the Irish people cannot be induced to take any interest
in lyceums or intellectual culture.</p>

<p>Nearly thus he described to me the aim of the farmers
in the present agitation. It is fifty years or more since
Griffith, an agent of the English government, made a
valuation of Irish lands. Since then rents have risen
in some cases one hundred per cent., and the Land
League is trying to reduce them to Griffith’s valuation.</p>

<p>When tenants are evicted, others are forbidden to take
them at the price demanded, and the evicted are supported
by contributions to the Land League. I myself
call it an agricultural strike.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Byrne says that there is much competition in
renting farms, no other business being open to the people.
This confirms the opinion of a publisher in Philadelphia,
who had attributed the state of Irish affairs to the want
of manufactures.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. O’Byrne kindly made inquiry for me, and I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
a farmer willing to take a boarder. To see him I went
by rail to a certain station. Near by I entered a humble
dwelling, where a man was working at his trade, besides
being a petty government officer. He talked pleasantly
on Irish affairs, and said that some landlords have
granted a reduction in rent of twenty-five per cent. I
repeated what an editor in New York had said of the
present condition of Irish affairs,—that bad harvests, the
competition of American beef and mutton, and the consequent
decrease in the value of real estate had made
the farmers unable to pay their rent.</p>

<p>The Irishman admitted that American meat is much
cheaper than theirs, but said that it had not brought
down the price of their own. He said that four or five
landlords and agents had been killed; at this a woman
present smiled; and a man added that it is a pity there
were not more. This was the only sanguinary remark
that I heard a poor Irishman make.</p>

<p>At the railroad station the train from the west was
behind time, and the agent suspected disturbances. When
it came it was mostly filled with soldiers, who called out
for water; but who reported no immediate disturbance.
At this station I was met by the farmer and his wife
with whom I was to lodge, who took me home in their
cart. I call him Maurice Collins. He was not very
poor for an Irish cultivator. He was doubtless considered
quite fortunate in owning a horse and cart, even if
the cart had no box and no seats, but was simply a bed
or frame. Upon it lay a great bag of corn-meal, upon
which sat Mrs. Collins and myself. I steadied myself
down-hill with one arm at her waist, while my right
hand grasped a projection of the cart. I expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
surprise at the number of ruined and abandoned dwellings,
for we were within ten miles of one of the largest
towns in Ireland. Collins said that farms once separate
have been thrown together. When the population of a
country falls thirty-seven per cent. in about thirty-four
years, or from over eight millions to about five, it is not
strange that abandoned houses are found when built
like these, of stone. Dwellings of mud and straw are
more readily demolished. Collins’s house was on rather
a sterile hill. To reach it we rose above the lower and
more fertile ground. On our arrival a chair was brought
out to enable us to alight from the cart. On entering
the house we were followed by a young man, who staggered
under the weight of the great five-bushel sack
on which we had sat in the wagon.</p>

<p>There were twelve in the family,—six boys, one girl
at home and one away, the old aunt, and the domestic.
The living room had an uneven floor of earth. Within
the front door stood the slop-barrel. A dresser of dishes
stood on the left, and beyond it there was a red-painted,
two-storied hen-coop. A hen and chickens occupied the
lower story, and a setting hen the upper one. A second
door faced the front door. It generally stood open, discovering
a little muddy yard. A great settle or couch
of wood stood on the same side of the room. Beyond it,
on a low seat, sat a little fair, weak-eyed old woman, the
aunt. She sat beside a small fire on the hearth, holding
the baby. With her left hand she turned a crank and
wheel, which by some invisible agency created an underground
draught to kindle the fire. The fire was generally
of coals. It bore no proportion to the fireplace,
which occupied a large part of the third side of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
I saw the girl hang over the fire a large Dutch oven,
called here a bastible. It was a round iron vessel with
a lid. On its top she kindled a fire of furze, and hung
the bastible to bake the large cake within, made of flour
not fully screened, sour milk, and soda.</p>

<p>At nightfall the barefooted little ones gathered to the
blaze, although it was in the month of June. The babe
in arms was Tim, the three-year-old Norah, and the five-year-old,
in trousers surmounted by a red woollen frock
and blue apron, was Dennis. At one end of the long
fireplace stood the heavy cradle. A steep staircase, almost
like a ladder with a railing, led to the rooms above,
for this house, roofed with slate instead of thatch, had a
loft with a board floor. Wet weather makes the uneven
earthen floors inconvenient. The water gathers in little
pools. The door to my room was at the foot of the
staircase. There were only two apartments on the
ground-floor.</p>

<p>The fourth side of the apartment was lighted by a
small window and the doorway through which we entered
the house. There were only two windows down-stairs,
one in this room and one in mine. They were
little iron-barred windows. I thought that they might
be taxed, but I was mistaken. Collins told me that the
glass came from England. They used to have glass-manufactories
in this country.</p>

<p>I had taken tea before my arrival, and Mrs. Collins
gave me some milk. She and her husband had been to
Cork, where, she said, they had a cup of tea and a penny
bun at a baker’s. (The penny is about two cents.) In
the evening we had a good talk. I commented on the
nice hen-house standing in the corner, and Mrs. Collins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
told me that they had lost several chickens by the fox.
“And do you still have foxes in Ireland?” I asked, in
some surprise.</p>

<p>“We do,” she replied.</p>

<p>“And that is what the gentlemen hunt?”</p>

<p>“It is,” she said.</p>

<p>“And can you kill the foxes?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” was the reply.</p>

<p>This I afterward thought must be an error, as foxes
are vermin; but a gentleman born in the north of Ireland
has told me that they would be evicted for killing
foxes. Sometimes hunting clubs pay for poultry killed
by foxes.</p>

<p>In the evening I spoke of the sun’s setting so late
and our being so far north, and asked the eldest son,
a youth of fourteen, whether he had studied geography.
He said he had, but his mother told me that he had been
obliged to leave school at eleven, and her manner seemed
sad and disapproving. There are no free schools in
Ireland like ours. The poorest citizens need not pay in
the national schools, but others must. A gentleman in
Dublin, who publishes a school journal, told me that
he doubted whether these schools would ever become
entirely free to the public, like those in my own State.
He had never heard that such a movement was contemplated.</p>

<p>In further conversation Mrs. Collins told me that they
had lost seven cows in eighteen months, and that they
were nearly broken down. They had to incur some
debt to replace them, and they must meet the rent or be
thrown upon the world. Their lease would expire in
about six years. Do not these misfortunes make them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
dwell very near to the Divine Father, in humble submission
and prayer?</p>

<p>About ten o’clock in the evening the wooden table was
put before the fireplace. The old aunt had gone to bed.
Collins was in one end of the fireplace, a boy asleep in
the other, and the eldest slept on the settle. Mrs. Collins
made tea and put a bowl of white sugar on the
table. She told me that sugar cost about five cents a
pound (two and a halfpence). They cut pieces off of the
great cake baked in the Dutch oven, and ate their supper
without any of the precious butter, which must go
to market. Little Norah had given a low laugh when
her mother handed her a bit of warm cake without anything
spread on it. Mr. and Mrs. Collins had milk in
their tea. The tea cost about forty cents a pound. Collins
helped himself quite freely to the cheap and nutritious
sugar, one of the blessings which the poor man
owes to free trade.</p>

<p>Collins and his wife gave up their own room to me.
It was the other room on the ground-floor. It also had
an earthen floor, with perhaps the addition of a little
cement, but it was not level. There I slept, and here
were set my simple meals, more luxurious, however,
than their own. Some of the dishes were of china,
which belonged to Collins’s grandmother. I had plenty
of milk, eggs, butter, tea, and baker’s bread. They
gave me goat’s milk, richer than cow’s milk, for tea.
For me especially Mrs. Collins procured meat, a bit of
jowl, but I am not partial to it. They did not, however,
go to the extravagance of eating it themselves. I
was told of a farmer’s family who had jowl and cabbage
for a Sunday dinner. A watch was set for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
agent, lest, seeing such evidences of prosperity, he might
raise the rent. Collins and his wife seldom ate meat.
He told me that he had two eggs in the morning and
the mistress one. They raised turkeys. Twenty-four
were running with one hen. The servant fed them with
a mixture of nettles, corn mush, and thick milk, but
she said they scarcely ever ate a turkey even at Christmas.</p>

<p>In the morning, at breakfast, Mrs. Collins had some
cold mush or stirabout cut up and boiled in sheep’s milk.
This saved bread and tea. I observed one day within
the back door, and by the chicken-coop, a little trough
with corn-meal. There seemed to be always food there.
The chickens came in and helped themselves. Seeing
a fowl eating, I said to the aunt, “That rooster ought to
be fat.” She did not understand me, and I tried again:</p>

<p>“That cock ought to be fat, he eats so much.”</p>

<p>“He do ate a dale, God bless him,” she said. She
meant “prosper him,” I think. Some neighbors visited
the family one morning, and from my room I heard
earnest talk. They spoke of the rumored arrest of
Father Murphy, which had caused much excitement.
One man came in who was full of talk of the Cork races
on the preceding day. At first, Mrs. Collins allowed
him to think that they were present, but they went to
sell butter, and did not go to the race-ground.</p>

<p>The girl swept the earthen floor with a bunch of
twigs without a handle. I mention these little things
to show the poverty of the country. They had no
almanacs at Collins’s and no clock, except a Connecticut
one, which did not run. Collins once intimated that it
was painful to have such a poor harness for his horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>One day I walked over to the school. I passed a
house licensed to sell beer and spirits to be drunk on the
premises. It was whitewashed, and looked better than
most of the farm-houses. The boys told me that tea and
sugar could be bought there. Bread was sold, but I
could buy no sticks of candy for the children. A carpenter-shop
and a blacksmith’s forge stood near this
public-house, but I saw no country stores like ours at
home.</p>

<p>The Collins family carried water some distance uphill
from a spring. This part of the country is supplied
from springs. They had excellent roads, apparently
macadamized, and free from tolls. When I spoke in
Cork of the great cost of such roads I was told that they
were probably made after the famine, when the government
gave laborers employment. The roads, however,
seemed deserted. Once I saw a man on horseback, and
occasionally market carts were seen, but of plain carriages,
like those of the farmers in Eastern Pennsylvania,
I remember none. Poverty hangs like a cloud over the
land. Yet the people seem honest. The servant-girl at
Collins’s said to me, “Nothing do ever be taken.” I
wished to know whether it was safe to leave my towels
to dry on furze bushes near the road. Afterward, in a
gentleman’s house,—a gentleman who lived in a disturbed
section, and whose tenants were not paying rent,—I
was told that they would not be afraid to have plate
in the house; the people there were honest.</p>

<p>Collins and his wife were trying to better their condition
by going to a market-town and buying butter, which
she brought home and reworked and packed into firkins
to sell in Cork. This consumed so much of their time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
that it was hard for me to see much profit in it. They
may have received five dollars a week more than the butter
cost them. Mrs. Collins was pleased in telling me of one
firkin or tub that brought the highest market price.
But during their absence the elder boys were left alone
at the farm-work. Nor did I see the great pressure of
labor found among our Pennsylvania German farmers.
This may be in part owing to open winters in Ireland,
which enable the former to work the year round, in part
to the fact that the patient, ox-like labor of the German
is not a trait of the Irishman, and partly to a national
disregard of time, producing such a proverb as “Hours
were made for slaves.” When I apologized for having
talked so long to a poor man and his wife, she answered,
“Sure, many a year we’ll rest in the grave.” Calling on
my friend Collins and his wife before I left the county, I
found they had gone with their horse to the funeral of
a much-respected neighbor, and as they were so long
absent, had doubtless accompanied the funeral to the
place of interment, twenty miles. A manufacturer in
the county Cork said that the Irish girls in the mills
are not greedy enough. They would rather have less
wages and more play. They were not indolent, but
a bit of fun would call them off. A Quaker lady
in Cork said to me, “None of the Irish are thrifty.
They do not value their time.” And afterward, “They
are a thrifty people in the north. They make use
of their time.” She herself was born in Ireland, but
when she spoke of the Irish she did not mean to
include herself. When any one called the Irish lazy,
I replied that they did not seem so in America. They
left their temperate climate, came to our country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
and constructed railroads under our broiling suns. I
heard in Ireland that girls who go to America say, “If
we had worked as hard in Ireland as we do in America,
we would have been well off there.”</p>

<p>I spoke of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s drinking tea at
supper. Once when they were absent, Mary, the servant,
came into my room to hide the teapot, lest the boys
should want sugar and bread.</p>

<p>“What do you give them for dinner?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Stirabout and new milk,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Potatoes?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“They do not care about potatoes,” she said.</p>

<p>Our corn-meal, among its many other Irish uses, seems
likely to supersede the national dish. What a change
since 1847, the year of the potato famine! This family
used Indian meal because it was cheaper than oatmeal,
but they did not like it so well. As for the inferior
animals, they occasionally give horses corn-meal, but
generally feed them in winter on oats, turnips, bran,
and hay. Indian meal and bran are fed to cows with
young calves. To pigs corn-meal is given the year
round, occasionally adding a few boiled potatoes, the
sortings. They are fattened on meal and sour milk
when it can be spared. Poultry abounds here, and
Ireland exports large quantities of eggs. I never saw
corn-meal at home stand so constantly in the chicken-trough
as at Collins’s.</p>

<p>I have said that the domestic came into my room to
hide the teapot. The cup which cheers but not inebriates
is in immense demand here. The old aunt wanted tea.
The children worried the girl for tea. The beggar-woman
insisted on tea. The three-year-old Norah says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
she has a pain and wants tea. It might be a very happy
thing for Ireland if the people would confine themselves
to such cups as these; but, while all other manufactures
are languishing in the county Cork, malt liquor
and whiskey distilleries are flourishing. (However, Scotland,
a Quaker told me, excelled Ireland in regular
drinking.) As to what constitutes moderate drinking,
I was amused by the remarks of a girl in Cork. Speaking
of young men, she said that she did not object to a
bottle of porter at dinner and one in the evening, but
seven or eight bottles a day she thought gluttony and a
sin. Porter, however, is not dear. On draught it sells
at about eight cents the quart imperial. Whiskey is quite
another thing. I hear that the tax on a gallon is twelve
shillings and ninepence, or about three dollars. It has
been said that Ireland pays more for liquor than for rent;
yet estimates given me show that while over nine millions
of pounds sterling are spent yearly on intoxicating drink,
the rent of the country amounts to thirteen million
pounds. Let no one jump to the conclusion that it is
the working farmers who expend this great amount, for
doubtless the small landlords are great consumers.</p>

<p>Distillers and brewers are great men in such a country.
I heard of several celebrated Protestant churches indebted
to them for funds. A distiller gave twenty thousand
pounds and a brewer ten thousand pounds to assist
in building or renewing an Episcopal cathedral in Cork.
It is said to have cost Guinness, the great brewer, two
hundred thousand pounds to remodel St. Patrick’s Episcopal
Church in Dublin and to build the appurtenant
houses. And a distiller gave a great sum to repair Christ
Church in the same city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>To return to my farmer, Collins, in whose house I
saw no intoxicating liquor drunk. He rented seventy
acres, of which twenty were bog, nearly worthless; the
peat for burning being all cut from the bog land in this
neighborhood. (Nor is the county Cork, taken altogether,
a rich agricultural tract. Lewis’s Topographical
Dictionary, 1837, gave the acreage at about one million
seven hundred thousand, of which about seven hundred
thousand acres were bog and mountain.)</p>

<p>Collins’s lease was for thirty-one years, of which six
remained. He has built the part of the house in which
we live, having slate-roofed it. He has also built a stone
stable and a small dairy, with slate roofs. The landlord
gave him almost nothing toward these improvements,
not even the flooring of the loft. The stone Collins got
off the place. When he came here the walls of the fields
were mostly of clay or mud, and he has built stone ones.
In this neighborhood the walls are mostly built of stone.
In some cases they are covered with earth, and grass and
other plants are growing on them. “These walls,” I
said to him, “must take up a great deal of room. That
one beside your house is a yard across the top.”</p>

<p class="tb">I have given Collins’s rent at about one hundred and
seventy dollars for seventy acres. Land sold in fee
simple, apparently a rare thing, generally brings twenty
times the annual rental. Yet, as a lawyer in Cork informed
me, the average value here now, under present
depressing circumstances, is not over seventy-five dollars
per acre.</p>

<p>I have spoken of some of Collins’s land as of inferior
quality. His report of its produce, I therefore infer, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
above the average crop. He says that on this land wheat
ought to bring fifteen hundred-weight per acre, the hundred-weight
of one hundred and twelve pounds. (This
is twenty-eight bushels, which would be considered a
fair crop in the wheat-growing region of Pennsylvania.)</p>

<p>Collins says that on land of best quality in good years
wheat is expected to bring twenty-five hundred-weight.
On his own land oats frequently brings fourteen hundred-weight
to the acre, or about forty-three bushels.
This land produces about one and one-half tons of hay,
and better land about two tons per acre. A patch of
potatoes is called a potato-garden, even if it contain several
acres. The manner in which potatoes are planted
was strange to my eye. The land is laid out in beds
about four feet wide. Between those beds are deep
trenches one and a half feet wide. These beds or ridges
are made by turning six sods in with the plough. There
are four rows of potatoes to a bed. These are hand-weeded,
and never hoed. The people manure as heavily
as they can for potatoes; and then, without additional
manure, put the land into wheat. Barn-yard, guano, and
artificial manures are used. On Collins’s soil potatoes
turn out about five tons to the acre, or about one hundred
and eighty-six bushels. Potatoes have degenerated
in Ireland; but of late a new kind, the Champion, has
encouraged the people much. At an exposition in Cork
in 1880, some farmers claimed to have raised from thirteen
to fifteen tons per acre, or about five hundred
bushels. Turnips are manured, sowed in drills or rows
in May and June, thinned, hoed, and hand-weeded.
They turn out twelve tons to the acre. Two men can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
fork out an acre in a day, and two men can top an acre
a day, leaving the tops on the ground.</p>

<p>Domestic animals sell high for food. Beeves sometimes
weigh thirteen and fourteen hundred-weight, and
bring about three pounds per hundred-weight. Good
fat calves of three months sell for five pounds. Fat
sheep, weighing dressed about one hundred and twenty
pounds, will bring three pounds, or near fifteen dollars.
Mrs. Collins had an exceptional pig, supposed to be a
fine bacon pig, lean and fat well mixed, or a “ribbon”
pig. (An Irishman is said to have fed his pig one day
and starved him the next, that there might be a streak
of fat and streak of lean.) That pig of Mrs. Collins’s
weighed when dressed one hundred and eighty-two
pounds, and she got four pounds and ten shillings for it,
or about twenty cents a pound. In view of such prices
the saying of my Cork landlady is not strange: “May
the Lord of heaven spare us the American meat! It
keeps the market within our reach.”</p>

<p>Fruit did not seem plentiful in the county Cork.
“The children would pluck gooseberries,” was a reason
given for not having them. A certain priest was supposed
to have strawberries and gooseberries in his garden,
but probably fruit-loving children did not disturb those
of his reverence. When a retired lawyer took me into
his garden he unlocked the gate. He had cut down an
old orchard and would not plant another, because the
neighboring children would get at the fruit. Thus, the
saying of the domestic, “Nothing do ever be taken,”
does not seem to apply to fruit.</p>

<p class="tb">I had several conversations with Collins. He freely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
expressed his disapproval or dislike of the British government.
Working farmers rarely or never subscribe
for a paper, but often buy one at a market-town. Collins
had got one in Cork, and wished me to see a speech
in it. He said that it alluded to a manufacturer at
Blarney who took a prize at our Centennial.</p>

<p>“What would you think,” said Collins, “when people
manufactured goods that they could not send them right
off from here to market, but must send them to Liverpool,
and have them unloaded and carted there, and then
sent back, causing that expense? Would you think that
was just?”</p>

<p>“That is not so now?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is; that manufacturer’s goods must all be
sent that way; and would you think that was justice?”</p>

<p>“It is pretty hard on him,” I answered.</p>

<p>“And is it justice?” he insisted. “You shall have
the paper and read the speech.”</p>

<p>In Cork I called to see Mr. Mahony, the manufacturer
referred to, who told me that there is no government
regulation to hamper their manufactures in any
way. It is doubtless a matter of convenience to ship
from a great port like Liverpool, vessels not caring to
stop and take on small quantities at Queenstown.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p class="tb">As Collins, his wife, and I were riding on the cart,
going to the market-town for butter, I asked whether he
expected that there would be a time when there would
be no rents to pay. He answered that he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<p>“I understood you to say the other evening that you
did,” I continued.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied; “there has been a proposition for
the government to take the lands, and the people to pay
rent for thirty years——”</p>

<p>“And then the land be theirs?” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yes” he answered; “but they will never grant
that. More moderate things they have refused. All
we want is reduced rents, as the people can no longer
pay high ones.”</p>

<p>On our return journey I had an admirable opportunity
to talk with him as he walked by the wagon. I
had called on a magistrate in the market-town, a Protestant
gentleman, who had seemed very ignorant or uncommunicative.
He had, however, suggested over-population
as a reason for the condition of Irish affairs. This magistrate
bore a military title. I handed to him the introduction
given me at Cork by the “Riverend Lawrence
O’Byrne.” Collins had suggested an officer of the market
as suitable to introduce me. But I was in haste,
and carried the letter. The magistrate said that he did
not know the person. “No,” said Collins, on my return,
“you were wrong in two things. You said you
were from Philadelphia, and they are afraid of the
Americans, or do not like them, and Father O’Byrne is
not their kind of man.”</p>

<p>I told Collins that some papers in America had said
that their magistrates should be elected, as with us in
some States. He replied that they are appointed from
the aristocracy, the land-holding class, and, of course,
in cases of dispute between landlords and tenants, their
sympathies are with their own class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<p>“If you were in America we should say that your
head is level,” I said; but I had to interpret the slang.</p>

<p>“There has been a change in Ireland,” he added,
“within some years. Formerly the wealthy classes and
the learned could make <i>jupes</i> of the Irish people, but of
late years there has been more education, and the people
see things differently. Ireland was a dark country before
the Catholic emancipation. Before the passage of
that act no Catholic could hold office in this country.
Now many places are open to them in the excise and
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Collins intimated that the English are wrong in fearing
the Catholic priests, for they counsel the people to
peaceful measures, and they are the only persons who
have sufficient authority over them to quiet them down.
I spoke of Father Murphy and of priests who had presided
at Land-League meetings.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Collins, “when peaceful measures were
advised.”</p>

<p>I replied that the government would not trust them
because it thought that the people might become excited
and burst from the priests’ control, and because they
feared that the priests might deceive them. The remark
did not please Collins. He said that the people
were excited at the report of Father Murphy’s arrest
because they are so united to their priests. “One is
already in prison,” he said, “Father Sheehey; and many
meetings have been held to petition the government to
release him and other leaders of the Land-League
movement.”</p>

<p>In a disturbed region in another part of the county
Cork I was told of a priest who had refused to join the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
League. The members would not send their children to
the national school under his supervision, and the people
thus opposed to him did not call him Canon Desmond,
but only Desmond. On the other hand, I was told of
two influential priests lately sent out of Cork by the
bishop for being too active in the Land League. They
were placed in country curacies—promotion backward—on
account of the influence of a wealthy Catholic clique,
which does not in politics hold to the Conservative, late
Lord Beaconsfield party, “like the Protestants,” but
holds to the Liberal party, which is midway between the
Conservatives and Land-Leaguers. It was added that
one of these priests had gone to Rome to lay his case
before the pope, not having been able to get the archbishop
to interfere. The archbishop did not think it
prudent to entertain the complaint.</p>

<p>Another of Collins’s remarks may seem unjust to the
government. He said that men’s constitutions have
changed. They are no longer able to live on potatoes.
They must have Indian meal and bread and tea. “I
think I would have been dead,” he said, “if I had been
kept on potatoes; and when men’s constitutions are
altered, any laws the government can make cannot have
effect.” But it is free trade in Great Britain and Ireland
that makes bread and tea cheap.</p>

<p>The great domestic manufactories of the people demand
a word. Collins wore to market one day a gray
frieze coat (there pronounced frize). Calling at the
house, I found an old woman engaged in spinning wool
for the boys’ clothing,—wool that had been beautifully
carded at a factory. Collins’s coat seemed to be black
and white wool mixed, but the frieze is often dyed blue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
or red, and is also used for women’s petticoats. The
question of the want of manufactures is a great and
somewhat puzzling one. At Dublin it was surprising
to find that even the matches in my chamber were
marked London. The want of coal has been given as
one reason of the want of manufactories, but there is
great and abundant water-power. The want of capital
is also given as a cause of the lack of manufactures, and
if we look into this point we come to two of the open
sores of Ireland,—absent capitalists and want of national
unity. In Guy’s Almanac may be found a list of
landholders of one thousand acres and upwards in the
county Cork, leaseholders of over ninety years being
put down as absolute owners. There are three hundred
and seventy-five of these landholders, of whom about
two hundred have residences in the county, and the
remainder are entirely non-resident,—nearly fifty per
cent.! As regards the want of capital, I asked a Protestant
banker why they did not combine and form companies
to manufacture. He replied, “As soon as eight
Irishmen combine to do a thing, nine will combine to
oppose them.” The want of unity is owing, at least in
part, to their being still two nations, if I may be allowed
to say so, the conquerors and the conquered.
Methodists and Quakers born in Ireland may be heard
speaking contemptuously of the Irish. A woman of
Scotch Presbyterian origin remarked, “It’s a common
saying, it’s a blessed land and a cursed people.” A
Friend in Dublin said to me that the Protestants of the
North are as bitter as the Catholics, “and more blamable,
as they have the Scriptures.” And I find the
statement in my note-book that those who desired to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
considered the “upper ten,” and Protestants from country
localities, speak very contemptuously of the Land
League. Finally, the laws are unequal, the qualification
for voters being higher in Ireland than in England.</p>

<p>On manufactures an Irish gentleman said to me,
“There are lots of American shoes brought to Cork.
Blacksmith’s tools, agricultural implements, and carpenter’s
tools are brought to this country from America.
There’s a finish and a style about them that they don’t
do here.” A Catholic manufacturer attributed the want
of manufactures to the lack of skill and knowledge in
the people; but does this account for the decline in
manufactures? As lately as 1837 there were one hundred
thousand hides tanned yearly at Cork. It had
seven iron-foundries, five factories of spades and shovels,
numerous and extensive paper-mills, and two large
houses making flint-glass.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But where are most of them
now? My sprightly little landlady at Cork, a Catholic,
expressed in very simple terms a natural reason for this
decline, saying, “We want energy, for there’s not an
atom of trade that the English did not spoil. There was
a cotton-factory here in Cork, and the English sent their
goods in and sold them a half-penny lower. They put
their foot upon these things, bless them! They have
crushed us out of the market in various ways. There is
a little screed of linen manufacture in the North, but I
believe that they cannot make it as good in England.”</p>

<p>However, Mr. Mahony, a successful manufacturer of
tweeds at Blarney, says that manufactures are reviving
in Ireland. He thinks that three hundred power-looms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
have been established within fifteen years. There is also
ship-building in the north.</p>

<p class="tb">I talked with another working farmer. He had a tidy
place near Cork, perhaps the neatest farm-house I saw,
although there was no floor and no window in the principal
room. Two hearty children and a domestic were
present. The wife had been confined that morning, and
the husband’s breath indicated potations. “Such,” said
my landlady, who accompanied me, “do not employ a
physician, but a ‘knowledgable woman.’ She is not
recommended for skill in her profession, but ‘she is
lucky.’ Had we gone into the room where the baby
was, it would have been insisted on that we should take
a glass of punch or we’d take away the beauty of the
baby.”</p>

<p>Dan Donovan, the father, said that he had sixty-five
acres, all tillable, for which he paid the landlord one
hundred and forty-two pounds yearly. He was also
obliged to pay twelve pounds a year to the widow of
the man who rented the farm before him. His taxes
amounted to about twenty-five pounds, if not more,
making the whole outlay in money about eight hundred
and fifty dollars a year for sixty-five acres. He had been
there about four years, and was only a yearly tenant, but
he had manured the farm and put it in heart. That he
was one of the very thriving farmers was evidenced by
his stock of eight cows, eight calves, a pair of horses and
a foal, a pair of donkeys, and twelve pigs. He employed
more hands than an American would employ on
so small a farm,—four “boys” or laborers at six shillings
a week and their diet and lodging, which cost him as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
much more. He told us that he could not get ahead at
all. “I am in debt to my master. He’s a very intelligent
man and fond of me. When I paid last year’s rent
the landlord promised some abatement this year.”</p>

<p>Donovan is a voter. To a person of experience I mentioned
how many hands Donovan employed. He answered,
“He cannot get along with less, as he hauls
manure from the city and hand-weeds.” The speaker
himself has four persons hand-weeding grain-fields,
“taking out thistles and dock-roots that a previous
tenant left as a boon.”</p>

<p>On another walk I saw two men beside the road, one
of them a remarkably neat old man, a farmer. They
confirmed what I had heard, that very few around there
could afford to save their hay and straw and feed cattle
during the winter to manure their farms. “How do
they manage, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Like that man,” pointing to a handsome field opposite;
“let land at five pounds an acre to those who
have manure-pits.”</p>

<p>Such, I understand, are men who, having donkey-carts,
go around Cork gathering from houses the offal
and garbage to throw into these pits.</p>

<p>I have said that Donovan was a voter, and this brings
up the most serious complaint that the Irish have against
the British government,—the inequality of the suffrage.
This inequality does not exist in country districts. In
counties in both countries the payment of an annual rent
of twelve pounds entitles a man to vote for members of
Parliament. But as Ireland is much poorer, doubtless
the number of these voters is less. The inequality
spoken of exists in boroughs. In England those living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
in towns have household suffrage, and even the lodger
franchise; but in Irish towns the parliamentary voter
must pay four pounds rent.</p>

<p>I have seen an estimate that in England two men out of
five are voters; and in Ireland only one out of five is a
voter. As to the operation of this high property qualification,
we may observe that the county of Cork, having
a population in 1871 of over five hundred thousand, returns
under fifteen thousand votes. The city, having
within the parliamentary boundary nearly ninety-eight
thousand, gives under five thousand votes! But here is
an illustration of the old rotten borough system of England:
The county of Cork, with over fourteen thousand
voters, elects two members at large. The city of Cork,
with over four thousand six hundred voters, elects two
members, while four boroughs in the county elect each a
member; Bandon having four hundred and thirty voters,
Mallow two hundred and ninety-three, Youghal two
hundred and eighty-nine, Kinsale one hundred and
ninety-four.</p>

<p>If, now, we come to teachers as voters, I hear that of
the teachers of Ireland not more than one-twentieth can
vote for members. This probably refers to teachers of
national schools, nearly resembling our public schools.</p>

<p class="tb">I boarded some days at a castle, the residence of a
gentleman who formerly belonged to one of the learned
professions. Had his tenants been paying rent, it is
possible that I should not have been received as a
boarder. To this castle I went by rail. On the way I
saw soldiers, of course, but they were so common that I
hardly noticed them. The castle was a handsome stone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
building in a grove. The wall of the old part measured
six feet in the embrasures of the windows. The new
part measured three feet. I was shown into a great
parlor, barely furnished, with a turf fire in the grate.
It was in June. I call my host Mr. Loftus. The family
were Protestant and Conservative, holding to the
Church of Ireland, as the Episcopal Church is called
since its disestablishment.</p>

<p>The tenants of Mr. Loftus sent a delegation to him.
They offered rent on the basis of Griffith’s valuation,
which Mr. Loftus declined. He offered to allow them
about one-fourth of the proposed reduction, or over sixteen
per cent. on the rate of rent. But they went away
without accepting his offer. Not to receive his rents
was inconvenient for him, to say the least, as he had
annuities to pay and bills to meet. Here I may add
that a lawyer in Cork told me that the present unsettled
state of affairs puts everybody on his guard against
spending money, and so the laborers suffer. Some
landlords have gone without their rent for two years,
perhaps longer. Thus the bottom seems to be dropping
out of society.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity in Irish affairs is the subletting
of land; thus I heard of a farmer who has three landlords
above him. To begin at the top, Mr. Prior lets
land to the Osbornes, who get it from him on a perpetual
lease for two shillings and sixpence per acre. The Osbornes
let land to Daniel McBride, who has bought
out a lease, but who has to pay also ten shillings and
three pence per acre. Daniel McBride has other occupations,
and does not work the land himself, but rents
to a farmer, who takes a portion of the land, and pays<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
McBride seventeen shillings per acre. As said farmer
holds thirty-six acres, possibly he has one or two laborers’
houses which he rents out to men who would thus have
four landlords above them.</p>

<p>To return to Mr. Loftus, the gentleman with whom I
boarded. He spoke to me of the condition of the laborers
in this district, which is but a poor one. It is natural
for the aristocracy to look at this point, when
farmers who are refusing them rent are themselves
receiving rent from laborers. “The farmers of this
country,” said Mr. Loftus, “are the worst in the world.
They drive the laborers very hard, and treat them badly.
Often they do not give them a house fit to put a pig
into. The houses are roofed with sods, as they want the
straw for farming purposes. Nearly all the poor people
lie on straw beds, and it is hard to get straw from the
farmers. They allow the laborer about one-fourth of an
acre for his potato-patch, and charge him rent of from
two pounds to four pounds, sometimes in advance. The
laborer’s wages may be counted at one shilling a day the
year round, and as his wife works in harvest, we may
reckon hers at sixpence a day for six months. I speak
only of my own neighborhood. I do not know the rates
in others. There is near here a cluster of about a dozen
cabins, all upon one farm. They are mud-walled and
wretchedly roofed. A quarter of an acre of miserable
boggy land is set apart for each tenant, and there is a
large pool of stagnant water opposite each house. The
tenant pays in advance three pounds and ten shillings
yearly. The farmer sometimes makes the whole rent of his
farm by what he receives from these people. I think
the place a nuisance, and liable to breed a fever. None<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
of these houses have windows, and many have no doors,
except bunches of furze. The walls are propped up on
the outside with pieces of bogwood to keep them from
tumbling down.”</p>

<p>The laborer, having no outbuildings, must necessarily
protect his precious domestic animals under his own roof.
Most laborers have a goat, and the poorest have poultry,
but since the potato famine pigs have not been kept as
before. Sometimes, however, there is a donkey.</p>

<p>“The children of the laborer,” said Mr. Loftus, “go
to the national school until they are about twelve years
old. In most cases they go winter and summer without
shoes and stockings. The laborer takes great pride and
pleasure in being able to send his children to school.
Laborers go to mass on Sunday, and in the afternoon
may often be seen in the house, or beside a ditch, reading
a newspaper. After mass they play ball in parties
against each other, or have a fiddler and dance on the
green or under trees. And they play cards, especially
in Dublin county, where you can see them on Sundays
playing on the banks of the ditches,”—i.e., under shelter
of a wall.</p>

<p>“What games do they play?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Forty-five and spoil five,” he replied.</p>

<p>The laborer has no political privileges. Unless he
pays a rent of over five pounds he pays no poor-rates,
and no other taxes except the county or grand jury cess,
and for malicious injuries, such as burnings. He pays
this tax, but is not allowed to vote. “Would you put
us under the Papists?” once cried an Irish Protestant
on the question of universal suffrage.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when Mr. Loftus’s man was driving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
for me, he spoke of the desire or the efforts of the
laborer to keep his little family together, for in the
unions or poor-houses the sexes are separated. Mr.
Loftus pointed out to me a building which he called the
curse of the country. It is a union. “Children,” he
said, “brought up there are well fed, and idle, and never
want to work.” The number of these houses and the
amount of money paid to sustain them seem almost incredible.
Mr. Loftus’s district is very heavily taxed,
about five shillings in the pound, or twenty-five per
cent. on the valuation of a man’s annual income. The
farmer pays this rate, but the landlord allows him half.
The county of Cork, with a population of about five
hundred thousand, has sixteen poor-houses. The one
in Mr. Loftus’s district contains about four hundred inmates,
and the one in Cork over one thousand. The
Cork poor-rate amounts to from two and one-quarter to
four shillings a pound annually on every pound valuation
of houses and lands, but the valuation for taxes is
only about sixty per cent. of the annual income.</p>

<p>When the country is poorest these taxes are heaviest.
Very few who go into the unions ever get out, excepting
children. Said a guardian of the poor, “What causes
the immense number of paupers in Ireland is the able-bodied
persons going away and leaving the old. All
the lower classes here speak of America as their home
or final place of settlement. When the people send
part of the money for their children, the board of poor-law
guardians will sometimes supplement it gratuitously
and send the children out. And at their own expense
the board sometimes sends out lots of young women that
are in the unions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>The region in which Mr. Loftus lives is a disturbed
one. On a recent Sunday a Land-League meeting was
to be held in the town. It had been extensively advertised
in the newspapers. On the day before the meeting
was to be held the lord lieutenant issued a proclamation
forbidding it. About two hundred dragoons and infantry
and one hundred armed police arrived at the
town, bringing with them provisions, as no farmer
nor storekeeper would dare to sell any to them. One
storekeeper had already been boycotted for not joining
the Land League. On the appointed Sunday, after
mass, or about one o’clock, some five or six thousand
people came together, with bands of music. Five or
six Roman Catholic clergymen were among them. The
people desired still to hold the meeting by erecting a
platform on some other spot. Two stipendiary, or salaried,
magistrates were present, and with them the priests
entered into an agreement that the soldiers and police
should not interfere with the people if they listened to
no speeches, but simply formed in an orderly procession
and paraded in the town. The affair went off peaceably,
and the people went quietly home, although feeling
much discontent at the action of the priests. If they
had not obeyed the contract, the priests would have retired
and left them to the mercy of the armed men.</p>

<p>At dinner, one day, in the course of conversation, Mr.
Loftus said, “The country is well enough if it was left
alone.”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “you approve perhaps of one agitator,
O’Connell; you like the effects of Catholic emancipation?”</p>

<p>“O’Connell!” he cried; “the best man Ireland ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
produced; a clever man. Not such a fellow as this
Parnell, that nobody knows where he sprung from; not
fit to clane O’Connell’s shoes in cleverness. O’Connell
never allowed any quarrelling or disturbance. He kept
up the agitation, but the people were kept in order.
The repeal collections were kept up, but there was nothing
like the burning, wounding, and killing that is
going on in these times.”</p>

<p>I asked whether there might not be a home parliament
for local affairs, and delegates to a general parliament.
He answered that the people are so much given
to contention that they could not carry on affairs. “If
half a dozen of them,” he added, “come together at a
poor-law meeting, they can’t behave themselves.”</p>

<p class="tb">After my return to Cork, an acquaintance advised me
to visit a town in the southwest, where manners are
more primitive. Accordingly I travelled thither, where
women in a shop may be heard talking the Irish language.
I went third-class. The railway terminated at
the town. Falling into conversation with an intelligent
fellow-traveller, he said that he had many men constructing
a road. He was a steward or overseer. Looking
out at the country, I asked, “Why are there no barns?”</p>

<p>“They have nothing to put into barns,” he replied.
“They sell their hay in the fields, and thresh their grain
and get it quickly into market. They even sell their
straw sometimes to meet their rent. Then when spring
comes the landlord endorses for them in the bank. This
answers for one year. On the next year the farmer
must go to a money-lender, to whom he signs a note for
twenty-five pounds, receiving only twenty pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>An intelligent Protestant, to whom I read this statement,
made some corrections. He said that the landlord
would only endorse for the rent, and the money-lender
would charge ten or fifteen per cent.</p>

<p>I cannot substitute a name for that of my next witness.
It is too well known, having been mentioned in
Parliament. John Coppithorne is a Methodist. In
politics, a Conservative. He says that if poor Beaconsfield
were in there would not be any of these disturbances.
He has a shop. He is a dyer, coloring frieze
for country-folks. He rents several acres of land, and,
finally, unfortunately for him, he lets “cars,” or keeps a
small posting establishment. It is on account of letting
vehicles to the police that he is boycotted. He has lived
for fifty-two years in the town of Skibbereen, in the
southwest, near Cape Clear. Skibbereen is the terminus
of the railroad, but beyond lies Skull, the residence of
Father Murphy. Father Murphy is a quiet Catholic
priest. One day a police-officer went into his house to
get him to use his influence with the people. But Father
Sheehy was already in jail, and the people, seeing the
policeman, flew to the idea that Father Murphy was to
be apprehended. A riot impended, and a message was
sent to Skibbereen for a reinforcement of police. Not
many police-officers were there, but they sent as many
as they thought they could spare, and unfortunate John
Coppithorne let them have cars to convey them, having
no idea that the people would break out as they did.
Mrs. Coppithorne was extremely alarmed when the mob
attacked their house. They began about nine <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and
continued at intervals until daylight, or about half-past
two. It was not alone the breaking of windows, doors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
and shutters which was alarming, but the accompanying
sounds. The women were dreadful, howling and laughing.
They brought stones in their aprons and encouraged
the men. Horns were blown all night on the
surrounding hills,—conch-shells and cows’ horns. The
military arrived by special train at three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, “and
their arrival was as grateful as at Lucknow,” said Mrs.
Coppithorne.</p>

<p>At an early hour of the night some of the mob suggested
to the priest that if the armed police were withdrawn
they themselves would disperse. The stipendiary
magistrate agreed to the proposition. The stipendiary,
or paid magistrate, commands the armed forces, soldiers
and police, in case of riot. So the police withdrew to
barracks, and the mob took the priest on their shoulders
and carried him home. The magistrate retired to his
hotel, and then the mob came back in double force.
Having before confined their efforts to the upper windows,
they now attacked the doors and shutters below,
and plundered the shop.</p>

<p>After all it was a false alarm, as Father Murphy was
not apprehended. Tears came into Coppithorne’s eyes
when I asked him the amount of his losses. I hear that
he claims damages to the extent of eight hundred pounds.
He says that his business, worth perhaps two hundred
pounds a year, is almost entirely ruined. Sometimes the
people will come creeping in, perhaps with a permit to
get frieze left to be dyed before the riot. There was a
man in the shop while I was there, who wanted some
frieze which some one had left for a petticoat. He had
lost the ticket. The clerk declined to let him have it.
“Only that the book was torn,” he said, “I could let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
you have it.” So the inconvenience of tearing books is
not all on one side.</p>

<p>John Coppithorne is familiar with the pecuniary condition
of the farmer. We could hardly expect him to
be prejudiced in the farmers’ favor. It is therefore
remarkable that he confirms the report of the desperate
condition of many of them. Of working farmers around
him, he estimates that ten per cent. have barns. About
fifty per cent. sell their hay. Then horses and cows are
fed in the winter on the young shoots of the furze,
chopped up for the purpose. (It is like donkeys eating
thistles.) Fifty per cent. of the farmers sell their straw,
and buy guano and phosphates. These are the small,
unthrifty farmers. The large ones buy these, and use
barn-yard manure also. But about fifty per cent. are
never forehanded enough to be able to make manure in
the winter sufficient to keep their land up to the
standard. Poor creatures that have only a few acres
can be seen going security for each other in the spring
to buy guano for their potato ground. They live on
potatoes, fish, milk, and Indian meal gruel.</p>

<p>About the same percentage sell all their grain to meet
their rent and pressing demands, and then buy, often on
credit, to feed themselves and animals. They buy their
seed grain on credit at a high rate, paying, if they pay
at all, after the next harvest. Legal process is not
infrequently used to oblige them to pay. If money had
not been sent into Ireland, and relief afforded by benevolent
persons, half of the farmers would not have had
seed potatoes in the spring of 1880.</p>

<p>Others at Skibbereen said that the competition is too
great when farms are to be rented, and some farms are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
entirely too small to support a family, even if they had
them rent free. Near the sea-coast an existence can
be eked out by fishing, but there are many in Ireland
cultivating five acres or less.</p>

<p>During my visit to Skibbereen I saw a funeral. The
corpse was followed by wailing women, for this old
custom still prevails. They buried the body at the
graveyard of the abbey, an old ruin, where the dead
were buried coffinless during the famine. It was so
desperate that these people, who have so great a regard
for funeral observances, would bury their dead, in some
cases, in fields near the houses, and the parish cart went
round and took up dead bodies that were buried in
trenches. This great famine was caused by the potato-rot.
A gentleman told me that at that time nineteen-twentieths
of the people rarely ate bread.</p>

<p class="tb">But whether Ireland has not long been subject to
famines is to me a question. Within two or three years
we have seen one averted by liberal contributions, and
there was one in 1822, or twenty-five years before the
great potato famine just mentioned.</p>

<p>While in the county Cork I met another person well
qualified to speak of the condition of farmers. Michael
McBride’s occupations were multifarious. He kept a
shop, and a public-house distinct from it. He farmed
many acres of land in different tracts. He sold his
cattle at the fair. A public-house is a drinking-place,
but McBride said that he drank no liquor himself. He
was not a member of the Land League. He turned out
a tenant and suffered by the League. While we talked
in a retired corner of his “public,” he occasionally spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
in a loud voice, as though for others to hear, in this
manner: “England is getting sixteen million pounds a
year out of this unfortunate country, and plunging people
into jail under the coercion act for saying nothing but
the truth.”</p>

<p>McBride appointed an hour for me to call again. In
the evening he had to go out and raise contributions for
the poor of the parish. “A very wild summer, thank
God,” he said, meaning a cold summer, unfavorable to
agriculture. (“We thank God for everything,” said my
landlady; “good, bad, or indifferent. One of my English
cousins could not believe that there was any reality
in thanking God for bad things.”) McBride said that
he held much land.</p>

<p>“Of course you employ some one to work it for you?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, bedad, yes,” he replied.</p>

<p>He said that there are men who sell their clover green
when in want of money, and who will even take off
two or three crops in the year and sell them green.</p>

<p>The poor farmer sells his hay, straw, and turnips to
pay his rent, and therefore cannot make barn-yard manure
in the winter. Guano was selling at thirteen pounds the
ton. “It is a great evil to rely on,” said McBride.
“The poor farmer may sell his oats at the glut of the
market at five pounds a ton, and afterward buy Indian
meal at seven pounds to feed his animals and himself.”</p>

<p>In February, McBride paid seven pounds per ton for
hay, but in the preceding summer at harvest the same
quality was less than two pounds per ton. He showed
me a note which he had signed to prevent a small farmer
or poor man from being turned out. Such must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
two endorsers; but McBride’s signature was enough,
because he was a man of means. At first he refused.
The man cried, for he was to be served with a writ if
he did not pay that day. The note runs in this manner:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“16th of June, 1881.</p>

<p>“On demand we jointly and severally, or any two of
us, promise to pay Messrs. Kelly &amp; Co., limited, Patrick
Street, Cork, or order, the sum of £10, for value received.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">David Smith.</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Michael McBride.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>McBride added that he supposed that he signed “a
thousand a year,” and lost as “often as I have hairs on
my head.” On the above note for ten pounds the borrower
was to pay ten shillings interest and sixpence
other charges for the use of the money for three months,
which is over twenty per cent. annually.</p>

<p>He said that of private bankers and money-lenders at
exorbitant rates there are twenty in Cork, some of them
pawnbrokers. In various towns there are many poor
people who pawn their clothing on Monday and redeem
it on Saturday.</p>

<p>McBride said that the great cause of the present embarrassment
is the three bad years of 1877, 1878, and
1879. Oats, wheat, barley, and potatoes were bad.
Some oat-fields were never cut. McBride said that seventy
per cent. of the farmers around Cork are unable to
pay their debts, and would be bankrupt if forced to do
so. They would need three good harvests to bring them
up. “They will never pay the same rents again. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
condition is owing to high rents, bad harvests, and
American competition.”</p>

<p class="tb">After leaving the county Cork I spent a few days in
Dublin. From persons on the train thither and in that
city I obtained information concerning other portions of
Ireland. To this I add the testimony of an Irish gentleman
well known in politics, whom I met in London.</p>

<p>A young man from the county of Limerick said that
that county is all pasture. Not more than forty per
cent. of the farmers in his neighborhood could afford to
save hay and straw and feed cattle in winter for manure.
Farms average from forty to fifty acres, some being as
small as ten. He knew one man who farmed over three
hundred acres, and paid three pounds and five shillings
per acre therefor. He had two or three acres in potatoes,
and the same in oats, but all the rest in pasture.</p>

<p>“Can he make money?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not these late years,” he replied. “He is served
with an ejectment because he can’t pay his rent.”</p>

<p>None of our farmers will be surprised that a man cannot
make money on grass-land at a rent of about sixteen
dollars per acre.</p>

<p>Another passenger, who was from Tipperary, said
that, with few exceptions, the farmers of that county can
keep cattle in winter and keep up their farms. Take the
whole of Ireland, however, and farm-lands are deteriorating
in value. In Tipperary and Limerick lies “the
Golden Vale,” celebrated for its fertility. I had an impression
that Tipperary was wild and riotous. In London
I spoke to the political gentleman above alluded to,
who knew the county well. In politics he is not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
unity with Parnell, and is opposed to the Land League;
but not, if we may judge by his conversation, to sanguinary
measures.</p>

<p>“Tipperary,” said he, “has not of late suffered so
much as some other districts. Thirty or forty years ago
the farmers were entirely at the mercy of their landlords.
They took the law into their own hands and fought for
their farms, shooting down the landlords or their agents.
Many of them were hanged or transported. The land
bill of 1870,” he continued, “extended to all Ireland,
restrains the landlord from evicting tenants without
leases, unless paying them for their improvements.” He
says that the present trouble is caused mainly by landlords
demanding increased rents.</p>

<p>My intelligent fellow-traveller from the county Tipperary
further said that the provisions of the proposed
land bill, by which the tenant is to hold his land as long
as he pays his rent, will do away with all abuses. The
Three F’s of the land bill are: First, Free sale,—that
is, the tenant is to have the privilege of selling his right
in the farm; second, Fixity of tenure; and, third, Fair
rent, to be determined by a court.</p>

<p>I remarked that this third F is against the free operation
of trade; that everything should be sold at its value
in the market. “No one puts such restrictions upon
trade as you Americans,” he replied.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Dublin I lodged at two different
temperance houses. In one I met a plain man from the
county Galway, in the west. He kept a shop, and was
a dealer in hides. He traded from town to town. He
said that his priest and bishop were good men, and that
young boys and girls were signing the pledge. Of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
farmers of Galway he estimated that seventy per cent.
are unable to pay their rent unless they sell horse, cow,
and calves; and even then they would be left in debt to
the shopkeeper. He complained greatly of the recent
coercion act, under which, he says, worthy citizens are
apprehended or are in danger.</p>

<p>One fellow-lodger was a Methodist minister from the
county Fermanagh, in the north. He had been attending
the Cork Conference. He complained of the increase
of luxury among farmers in buying tea and bread
and in the clothing of their daughters, and spoke of
their spending two days a week at market, and five or
six shillings each time in treating each other.</p>

<p>“But your congregations are not of this class?” I
said.</p>

<p>“Indeed they are,” he answered. “There are plenty
in my congregation who come home tipsy every market
night.”</p>

<p>He afterward took out change and called for a bottle
of ale. They sent out and got it for him.</p>

<p>I was much interested in the conversation of two men
who were dining at the house. One of them, a young
man, said that the three F’s would not satisfy the Land-Leaguers.
They wanted the extermination of the landlords
and the possession of the land. The other did
not agree with him. He said, “It would be a nice thing
for you to be paying two pounds and ten shillings for
land, and a Land-Leaguer over the fence be getting it
for half the money. I am an Orangeman,” he added,
“and the son of an Orangeman, and the grandson of an
Orangeman, yet I am greatly in sympathy with the poor,
suffering tenantry of this country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>He said of himself that he had been in the army nine
years; that he was a landlord in a small way, five or
six hundred pounds a year; and that he was now
lying out of rents. Rather than disturb tenants he had
paid as high as ten per cent. for money, and “glad to
get it at that.” He was originally from the county
Cavan, northwest of Dublin. He said that the average
size of farms there is about twelve acres. Some have
thirty. About twenty per cent. of the farmers own
horses. Many keep donkeys, but these are unfit for
farming. They put out manure with jennets, which are
not fit for ploughing. The poor farmer must wait until
the richer one has done ploughing so as to hire horses, and
then the land is ploughed shallow and injured. Both
speakers were agreed on the trouble of hiring horses.
You must pay ten shillings a day for a pair, feed them
and the ploughman, and give him several glasses of
whiskey, added one. If you have cash in hand, you can
get horses when you will; but the small farmer cannot
pay until he has harvested his crop. He generally pays
labor in exchange for horses.</p>

<p>A suggestion that the British government should buy
the lands of Ireland, rent them for the space of thirty
years, and that the people should then become possessors,
met with some favor. The Irish politician whom
I met in London found two objections to this plan:
First, that it would take from the country the cultivated
class; and, second, that for thirty years it would drain
the country of money.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ENGLISH">ENGLISH.</h2>

</div>

<p>I spent a few weeks in England in 1881, and visited
three agricultural regions in the east, the north, and the
south. An article on the last is to appear in <i>Harpers’
Magazine</i>. The following is drawn principally from my
visit to the east. Some account of my stay in the north
and of a few days in a manufacturing county may appear
hereafter.</p>

<p>My authority for the statements in the following
article is almost entirely notes taken at the time, assisted
in a small degree by recollections. But it cannot be assumed
that this essay is without faults.</p>

<p>With regard to another country, I was advised to tell
what I saw and how it impressed my mind, and not to
endeavor to draw conclusions. But what a traveller sees
and hears is greatly influenced by his own opinions. He
goes to a foreign land, and if of different religious institutions
from his own, he inquires on this point; of a
different form of government, he asks political questions.
He notices, also, differences in dress, food, and manner of
living.</p>

<p>The first family with whom I boarded in Huntingdonshire
was that of Mr. Jackson, a carpenter, who, besides
working at his trade, rented a few acres. His wife, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
was a farmer’s daughter, had a small dairy of three cows.
Jackson appeared to have a splendid constitution. He
was short and somewhat thick-set. He began his trade
at eighteen, and was an apprentice five years and a journeyman
three, when, having put by some money, he
married at twenty-six. His wife was near thirty. One
of them said that they had prospered with the help of
the Lord.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jackson also had been able to save something
wherewith to furnish a house. She learned a trade, and
was also companion or lady’s-maid to sick ladies and
those going to Brighton. One of them made her a wedding
present of neat china.</p>

<p>Jackson and his wife have four children,—the eldest
about six, or as she says, “Four little children, not one
of them able to put on a shoe nor a stocking.” She
attends to her dairy, boards the apprentice, and has no
servant.</p>

<p>Their children are sweet and clean. Three of them
go to the public school in the village. It is called the
national school. Mrs. Jackson gave the eldest three
pence to pay for their instruction for a week; which is
at the rate of about twenty-four cents a quarter for each
of them. The penny is a trifle over two cents, the shilling
a little under a quarter of a dollar; but in turning
sterling money into our own, it will avoid repetition to
consider the English penny as two cents, and four shillings
as a dollar.</p>

<p>The Jacksons’ house seemed a perfect palace compared
to that of any working farmer that I saw in Ireland.
Coming freshly from that country, I thought it
must be the gem of the village, but I was mistaken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
The busy activity of the Jacksons, who have a young
family to keep, was more like what I have seen at home
than what I saw in Ireland.</p>

<p>The house has a peculiar name placed on the front,
something like Hallelujah House. Doubtless it was built
by a dissenter. I saw another bearing title Bunyan
Lodge.</p>

<p>A lodging-room was assigned to me, and I ate by
myself in one of the front rooms below. (Thus to take
lodgings is very common in England.) Jackson and his
wife ate in the kitchen. When they had finished, she
gave the apprentice what she chose. My room had
strips of carpet on the floor, neat white curtains at the
window, a suitable toilet service, linen sheets and pillow-cases.
There stood in it a neat red chest with iron bands
at the corners, and a white fringed cloth covering the
top. It was locked, expressive of thrifty housekeeping.</p>

<p>Jackson and his wife do not go to the gray Church of
England, which, with its spire, overlooks the trees. They
attend the brick chapel, being Independents.</p>

<p>After he had taken me to see his calves and pigs, I
asked him what proportion of the farmers in the neighborhood
belonged to the Church of England.</p>

<p>He answered, “About one-half. I think that is just
about the proportion that voted last year.”</p>

<p>This answer amused me much, but I feared that his
wife would not understand why I laughed.</p>

<p>“You mean to say,” I said, “that large landed proprietors
expect those who rent from them to go to
church?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “or they would not rent to them.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said I, “it is not put into the leases.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
But how can they know how they vote now that you
have the secret ballot?”</p>

<p>“They go round and ask them, and if they would
not promise, they would lose their farms. Many a
farmer has been turned out because he would not vote
for his landlord’s party.”</p>

<p>On another occasion I spoke to him of the wars which
England had lately waged in Asia and South Africa,
and Jackson spoke of the deficit in the finances when
the Liberals came in. He said that he believed their
country has had to smart very severely for unnecessary
wars and bloodshed, and added, “Because it was a smart
little country, what business had we to go and say to
other nations, ‘You shall do as we please’?”</p>

<p class="tb">I did not stay many days with the Jacksons. Mrs.
J. considered the burden of a dairy and of young children
to be enough without taking lodgers. I was recommended
to the house of Mr. Benton, the principal farmer
in the village, and a friend called with me and introduced
me to Mrs. B., who after an interval for deliberation
consented to take me as a boarder at their family
table.</p>

<p>Benton farmed about seven hundred acres, but not all
in one tract. He owned a small part, and rented from
various persons. One large farm he had taken at a
heavy rent, and he was worried in these hard times. He
used to follow the plough when a boy, but he cannot now,
having so much to do in walking around and superintending
work.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Benton adhered to the Established
Church. He began to attend Sunday-school early, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
at two years, and had attended ever since, he being
fifty, and a teacher. He was church-warden, and the
most considerable parishioner in attendance; but was
not on equal visiting terms with the clergyman.</p>

<p>He was more reserved than his wife; he said that
the English did not incline to make new friends. He
seemed to hold to the same opinions that he cherished
in early life; to be of warm and constant attachments,
and not free from prejudice. He said that Ireland should
be sunk for twenty-four hours and repeopled with English
and Scotch; that the reason the poor-rates are so
heavy in Ireland is that the people are so lazy. He
declined to tell to which political party he held, saying
that the ballot is secret. He remarked of ourselves that
he wished “the Americans would let our things go in
there free, same as we let their things.”</p>

<p>The Bentons had seven children, five of them daughters.
The eldest son was twenty-one, and was actively
employed attending to farm operations. The girls had
taken music lessons, and could play upon the piano. The
eldest two were away learning dressmaking, and Mrs.
Benton thought that she might be able to get a place as
lady’s-maid for one or more of her girls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton had a large house, kept in good order.
She was tall, fair, good-looking, active, and sprightly.
She said that she “would rather have a penny of her
own <i>hearning</i> than tuppence that anybody should give
her.” She did her housework with the help of the
young daughters left at home. She said that, as a general
rule, the tenant farmers had brought up their children
too high, had hired servants, and now that these
hard times had come, they had failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Benton’s housework is not like that of the
wife of a large farmer in Pennsylvania. She does not
board any of the farm hands; the only thing of the
kind that they do now is to give them their beer in “’aytime.”
She hires a woman to help wash. In summer
they wash about once in eight weeks, and in winter
more rarely, having plenty of clothes. The washing
is done in two days, Saturday and Monday. Mrs. B.
and her daughters do the ironing, though sometimes she
puts out a frilled petticoat. They iron only the starched
things; the others are mangled.</p>

<p>Nor does Mrs. Benton have the labor of milking, for
it is done by one of the hired men. In the care of
poultry she has the assistance of the shepherd’s wife, who
raises chickens at their own house. Mrs. B. furnishes
feed, and pays her eight cents for every fowl that she
raises, and four for every twenty eggs that she brings
her. She pays her own daughter a trifle for the eggs
which she brings in at the home-place.</p>

<p>As regards the number of meals that she gave her
family, we had four daily; for, in addition to the afternoon
tea, we had a late supper. I noted one. All the
young children had gone to bed, for Mrs. Benton was
an excellent house-mother. For supper, we had onions,
soft cheese, bread, cold pork, stout for the mother to
drink, and ale for the father. After supper, Benton
read aloud a small portion of the New Testament; the
son of twenty-one before going to bed kissed his mother
and bade his father good-night, and the daughter kissed
both parents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton asked a blessing at meals: “For what we
are about to receive may the Lord make us thankful, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.” Thanks were returned by
the young children. One said, “Thank God, father and
mother, for a very good tea. Amen.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton delivers tracts. She takes them to dissenters’
houses; for the plan on which “the church”
acts seems to be that all these are only stray sheep from
their fold. They are indeed parishioners. Jackson, the
carpenter with whom I boarded, as he rented land, was
obliged to pay tithes for the support of the clergyman,
although he himself was an Independent or Congregationalist.</p>

<p>Though she is a church-woman, Mrs. Benton tells me
that one of her uncles is a bitter dissenter. He would not
open a prayer-book, and even objected to the repetition
of the Lord’s Prayer at the close of another supplication.</p>

<h3>FARMS AND FARMERS.</h3>

<p>This village where the Bentons lived closely adjoins
the fenny or swampy land of the east of England. Said
Benton, “Perhaps a hundred years ago the fens grew
nothing but reeds and rushes and produced a quantity
of wild fowl.” “All the geese in Lincoln fens” I had
before heard of. The water is now kept out of the fens
by means of steam-engines. This level land is well
fitted for tillage, but bad weather had been very unfortunate
for the wheat farmer. He generally holds more
land than the dairy farmer, but he had been suffering
from a succession of wet harvests. Before the abolition
of the corn laws, high prices were kept up by a duty on
foreign grain, but now the farmer cannot compete with
our Western grain. An experienced man told me that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
the man who held even as high as one thousand acres
was going behind every year.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1881, before the harvest was gathered
in, I was told that there had not been a dry harvest
since 1874. Some idea of what an English summer can
be was given to me by Benton, the farmer with whom I
boarded. He said that in 1879, at a Royal Agricultural
Show near London, the farm implements were up to the
hub in mud, and boards were spread for people to walk
upon. In meeting, some would get shoved off up to
the knees in mud. Men did not go round offering to
black shoes, but with pails of water to wash off the mud.
Yet there were thousands there.</p>

<p>The average of wheat raised in England is much
greater than ours. In this country we do not hoe wheat
and then weed it. But the production of England is
scarcely half the amount required for the population.
In 1880 the amount raised was sixty-four millions of
bushels; the amount needed, one hundred and seventy-six
millions. In 1881 they hoped to get one hundred
millions of their own produce. One of my friends said
that they would have starved the last year or two but for
America.</p>

<p>In considering the English climate it is well to remember
the high northern latitude. There is no city on our
continent, not even Quebec, which is so far north as
Paris. London lies in the latitude of Newfoundland
and Labrador. Whether wet climates like that of
England and Ireland can successfully compete in wheat-raising
in the long run with our drier ones may well be
doubted.</p>

<p>Another acquaintance spoke to me of the depressed condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
of this district. He said that within a radius of six
miles, six large farmers, cultivating three or four hundred
acres each, had failed since the last harvest. “For four
years,” he added, “the seasons have seemed to alter,—snow
and rain fell in seed-time; there was little or no
sun to mature the grain at harvest. There were floods
of water covering acres of ground, so that one farmer
holding perhaps five hundred or more acres, that had
also been cultivated by his father and grandfather,
lost in three years about twenty thousand dollars. Then
he took his remaining capital and went into other business.”</p>

<p>It was surprising to one accustomed to the small farms
of the fertile district in which I live to find such large
farmers as many of the English. Said one of my acquaintances
in Huntingdonshire, “One who farms fifty
acres is scarcely called a farmer. He farms a little land.
In another county I know a farmer who holds fifteen
hundred acres.” The tendency of course is largely to
increase the number of farm-laborers, while diminishing
the number of those who farm themselves.</p>

<p>The farmer with whom I boarded employed a large
number of hands, forty I think, in the spring. In July
he had four men hoeing turnips, potatoes, “mangles”
(mangel-wurzels?), and kohl-rabi. He had also about
eleven children pulling weeds out of wheat, barley, and
oats.</p>

<p>He kept twenty working horses, and with them had
eight or ten hands. In the earlier season he had twenty
hands hoeing wheat, barley, oats, beans, and peas. He
had a shepherd to look after about two hundred sheep.
He employs some women, girls, and boys. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
early morning I heard a peculiar cry as of a boy calling
the cows, but he was crying to keep away the birds
that depredate on the wheat,—linnets, sparrows, and
blackbirds in the hedges. Benton also employed hands
to go over fields that were to be planted in potatoes,
turnips, buckwheat, and to pick twitch out of them.
This, he said, is a wild and very troublesome grass,
that fills the ground with roots, so that nothing else can
grow.</p>

<p>I have just mentioned buckwheat. Benton had about
thirty acres in this grain. It is fed to pigs and other
animals; he said that he had never heard of its being
eaten by men.</p>

<p>One of the most surprising things to me was the short
number of hours that the farm-laborers made. That
men should quit farm-work in July at or before six in
the evening was novel to me. But all the work that is
possible Benton puts out by the piece.</p>

<p class="tb">The price of land in this arable region is differently
reported. One told me that it can be bought in fee
simple for from two to three hundred dollars per acre.
Perhaps this is the fen land and more valuable. The
village in which I boarded was at a small distance from
the fens. Land around this village sells at from one
hundred to five hundred dollars per acre, but the latter
are nice bits around the village. Land can be rented
in this or the fenny region for farming at about nine
dollars per acre. The tenure on which lands are held it
was hard for me to understand. For instance, I was
told that copyhold is nearly as good as freehold. At
some length a friend endeavored to explain to me copyhold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
fine arbitrary, and then said that copyhold fine
certain is more desirable.</p>

<p>In the depressed condition of farming of which I
have spoken, it has been found that grazing and dairy
farms are more profitable than grain. The abolition of
the corn laws, said a friend, made bread cheap and enabled
the mechanic and manufacturer to live, and they
can buy more meat than before, and grazing and dairy
farms are very profitable. Grain, which can readily be
transported by sea, comes more closely into competition
with the English grain than meat does.</p>

<p>One of the persons whom I met in Huntingdonshire
was a retired farmer, and must have been a successful
one. When he began to farm the fen land, that which
he held had lately been brought under complete drainage,
and was comparatively new. About 1835, on
twenty-four acres of land he had the exceptional crop of
sixty-four bushels of wheat to the acre. He has often
grown four hundred bushels of potatoes to the acre on
twenty-five acres, and he thought that his average yield
had been three hundred bushels. He has had potatoes
growing to the height of three feet, level as a floor, and
not a weed to be seen. “There should not be a weed
seen in an acre. I have grown,” he continued, “one
hundred and twelve bushels of oats to the acre, and did
not think that I had a crop under eighty-four. However,
I did what none of you Americans do. In the latter
part of my time, when I farmed only one hundred
acres, I used six thousand dollars a year (twelve hundred
pounds) in fertilizing my farm. Thus I bought six
thousand dollars’ worth of grain and fed animals, especially
pigs. Further, I sold the best of my wheat, oats,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
and potatoes, and consumed all the rest of my produce
on the farm. I find no one who has fed so much on
one hundred acres.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mrs. Benton took me one evening to see a steam-plough
or cultivator at work. It did the ploughing well here
when the weather was sufficiently dry. It was an immense
affair. There were two steam-engines, one on each side of
the field, sending the cultivator back and forth. The
whole cost of the machine (including the van for the men
to sleep in) was about ten thousand dollars. The charge
for ploughing was three dollars per acre (twelve shillings),
and the farmer furnished coal and perhaps also one hand.
The men who brought the plough boarded themselves.
They were making long days, from four in the morning
to nine at night. By working until ten, they could cultivate
twenty acres per day, and in these high northern
latitudes summer days are very long.</p>

<p class="tb">During my short stay in the east I heard the price
of a few articles, principally farm products. Mrs. Jackson,
wife of the carpenter with whom I boarded, had
prepared for me (in July) a very nice sparerib of pork,
for which she paid eighteen cents per pound. She
thought that no mutton could be bought under twenty.
She had understood that meat was dearer than with us
and clothing cheaper. Bread was cheap, she said. But
I have before quoted the saying that they would have
starved lately but for America.</p>

<p>“After midsummer is turned,” said Mrs. Jackson,
“butter grows dearer. The pasture is shorter, and milk
will not keep.” It was then selling at thirty-two cents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
the pound, but last summer it was dearer. At supper
she and her husband had a large piece of good cheese.
I heard that the best American was bringing sixteen
cents (eight pence). Leicester cheese, which used to cost
about twenty-four cents, no longer sells here.</p>

<p>Benton, the farmer, said that American hams are
very poor. I endeavored to inform him how finely
swine are fed on corn in Illinois, but he said that the
difficulty is not in the feeding, but in the manner of
curing the meat. For American bacon they thought
that they paid thirteen cents.</p>

<p>In conversation, Benton spoke of eleven fat beasts
(beeves) that would have brought two hundred and fifty
dollars last year, but had sold much lower this year, on
account of the American beef coming in.</p>

<p>As regards milk, a retired farmer told me that he
used to sell it at about ten cents the imperial gallon in
summer and twelve in winter, and he had to convey
it five miles to the railroad station. It had now risen a
penny the gallon.</p>

<h3>THE CHURCH AND THE RECTOR.</h3>

<p>Two adjacent villages formed here one parish, which
may be called Haddenham cum Stonea, from said villages.
The living was a good one, as the rector received
his house and six thousand dollars a year. This income
was principally drawn from tithes, which amounted to
about two dollars per acre on the arable land in the
parish, and to near five thousand five hundred dollars
yearly. From glebe land he drew the remainder of
his income. He was, however, bound to keep his house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
in repair, and for the last eighteen months he had not
drawn his full income.</p>

<p>Benton was the principal parishioner in attendance
at church. His family, however, did not associate on
equal terms with that of Mr. Rounce, the rector. On
the occasion of a wedding-breakfast, Mr. Rounce had
taken a meal at the farmer’s, and Benton had dined
at the rectory on the occasion of a church meeting.
But Mrs. Benton did not expect the rector and his
daughters to associate with them equally. I heard an
intimation that the rector was originally poor, but no
one who attended the church was now on a social level
with himself.</p>

<p>I attended one Sunday afternoon. The congregation
was not large, and very few looked well-to-do. The
number of communicants, I was told, was over sixty.
One young man, who came into church, was showy in
appearance. He was neatly dressed, with plenty of
large, silvery-looking buttons. He was the rector’s footman.</p>

<p>The church was a gray stone building. Though plain,
its appearance over the level fields was agreeable. The
curtains within were rather shabby. From one at the
end the rector emerged, so I suppose it concealed the
vestry-room. In appearance Mr. Rounce, the rector,
was blustering and brawny. His lungs seemed brazen,
but perhaps some of the congregation were deaf. He
wore a white linen robe, and upon his shoulders behind
lay a mantle or hood of black, faced with magenta color.
The text of the sermon was, “Not slothful in business;
fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.” I took some brief
notes, which I reproduce. They contained one very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
happy, and, as adapted to the congregation, one very
unhappy, remark. He said that it is difficult to continue
piety amidst the cares of daily business. “I was going
to compare this to tar, to being surrounded by tar; very
dirty, very sticky.</p>

<p>“There are people who shut themselves up in cells
with one small bed, a chair, and a candle. This is the
way that many are taking to become fervent in spirit,
forgetting the first part of the text, diligent in business.
In my young days there were but six monasteries and
nunneries in all England, Scotland, and Wales; now
they number over six hundred.</p>

<p>“There are some who think that their religious exercises
should be confined to Sunday. There are various
things that we shouldn’t do on Sunday; it’s quite right
we shouldn’t read newspapers on Sunday. But religion
has thus been defined: it is the art of being and doing
good.”</p>

<p>As we left the church, I asked its age, and the rector
said that it was of the time of Henry VII. (who died in
1509). What is old has a great attraction to the people
of our new country, and I looked in the churchyard
for interesting monumental stones. The oldest that
could be deciphered bore date 1672, and seemed to be
that of a great pugilist. The gravestones were not
numerous and showy. Some one told me afterwards that
those who attend the church are the poorest of the poor,
and are generally buried without tombstones.</p>

<p>Concerning the rector, I ventured to draw some conclusions
as follows: Mr. Rounce is a strict Sabbatarian,
between two fires,—Dissent on the one hand and High-Churchdom
and Papacy on the other. In the eyes of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
zealous incumbent of the English Church, even of a
zealous low-churchman, all the people living in the
parish are his people. But many, very many of them,
are like lost sheep wandering on the barren mountains of
Dissent, and so long have they refused to hear even the
church that they have become to him like heathen men
and publicans, and with them he does not wish to hold
intercourse. He employs members of his own church,
however, to distribute tracts among them as regularly as
among his chosen people, even although these dissenters
are full communicants in their own “chapels.”</p>

<p>I was allowed to visit the rectory grounds and afterward
to see the house itself, through the courtesy of
an assistant in the National school, who was also a
servant in the rector’s family. The house was not so
much distinguished by the elegance of its carpets and
other furniture as by the number and variety of its
cabinets (among them I may reckon a great carved
chest), by the quantity of china displayed, and to some
extent by paintings and natural history collections.
The ladies were absent, but I met the rector for a moment
or two, and it seemed to me that he considered me
to need pruning or cutting down. But he was kind
enough to allow the lady’s-maid who conducted me to
find for me in the library one or two works which I
wished to consult, and she was sufficiently intelligent to
aid me, and obliging enough to do so.</p>

<p>When we walked through the garden I observed that
a net was spread to protect cherries from the birds, and
that currants were trained to the top of the wall, about
eight feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton, the farmer’s wife, received a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
the former rector. She said that he had removed to
the “’op” country, to Kent. She described him as a
tiny little man, over eighty, a very stanch liberal in
politics; a clever, very learned man.</p>

<p>While I was still in the village, Mr. Rounce’s two
daughters had a lawn-tennis party on their grounds, and
the guests could be seen from the road. Three of the
men appeared to be “in their shirt-sleeves.” I learned
at Mr. Benton’s that the guests would be about fifty
in number, the farmer’s young daughters being permitted
to look on. It was thought that the refreshments
would be tea, coffee, and cakes, handed round,—Miss
Rounce being a teetotaller.</p>

<h3>DISSENTERS.</h3>

<p>A rector of the Established Church, whom I met upon
a railroad train, spoke to me of there being here one
hundred and fifty different religious sects, but the number
seemed incredible. Afterwards, however, an acquaintance
pointed out to me the list in Whitaker’s
Almanac for 1881. This list is headed</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“Religious sects. Places of Worship.</p>

<p>“Places of meeting for religious worship in England
and Wales have been certified to the Registrar-General
on behalf of persons described as follows.”</p>

</div>

<p>And the list, instead of numbering one hundred and
fifty only, goes up at least to one hundred and sixty-nine.</p>

<p>The dissenting chapel in the village which I am endeavoring
to describe was a brick edifice, and the yard
contained a number of conspicuous monumental stones.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
Two prominent sects were united to compose the congregation,
and the number of communicants was one hundred
and thirty. I call the building a chapel, as the
English do; nothing is a church, in fashionable speech,
that does not belong to the establishment.</p>

<p>There was within the bounds of the parish a third
“meeting-house,” where the assembly is composed
mainly of a few members of a religious body, generally
respected, but declining in numbers. I had a letter of
introduction to one of the members here, and when I
spoke of her to Mrs. Jackson, the carpenter’s wife, Mrs.
J. told me that I might be able to receive an introduction
to others by means of her to whom the letter was
addressed, who was a person of education and the wife
of a retired farmer.</p>

<p>“Now,” I asked, “how likely shall I be to see the
rector?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all!” There is such a strong feeling
against dissenters is one reason why I should not meet
him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a dissenting minister, in speaking
to me of the Established Church, remarked that the feeling
against it is more political than religious. There
is nothing, he added, in the doctrines of the Church of
England that is repugnant to a vast number of people
who attend dissenting churches; the objection is to a religious
denomination which is elevated by the state over
others, and consequently has greater social power and
prestige.</p>

<p>But one whom I met at a neighboring town spoke
more strongly. He was a retired farmer who had travelled
in our country. He brought forward the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
objections to an established church. The people
have little or no choice as regards their own clergyman;
they have no control over their own forms of worship;
and all spiritual life is destroyed in the church.</p>

<p>In further conversation he said, “Can I forget that I
am socially persecuted because I am a dissenter; that my
father was commercially persecuted for being a dissenter,—he
could not rent a farm on equal terms; that my
grandfather was probably excluded from holding office
for being a dissenter; and my great-grandfather, if a dissenter,
would have been thrown into jail for attending
a conventicle. But it may be said, ‘Why rake up old
sores?’ Simply because the same persecuting spirit remains,
and if the dissenters were not so strong in numbers,
and consequently in political power and wealth, the
same things would be done again.” He added that no
farmer should be a dissenter. He himself belonged to
a Liberation society. He wondered at the apathy of the
Americans in not sympathizing with them in their efforts
against an established church. (I have given my friend’s
words from my notes, but I suspect that the date at
which Quakers and others were imprisoned in England
was not so recent as that of the gentleman’s great-grandfather.)</p>

<p>The following anecdote was given to me by another
person, also a retired farmer. It concerns a man of some
distinction, now dead, and who did not bear the name
which I assign him. This as well as others are substitutes.
My friend told me that when Carter Gray rented
a mill from Lady Letitia Robyn he also rented from her
a large farm, which he conducted to much profit. He
built schools in his neighborhood and also a dissenting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
chapel, and the clergy got at the Lady Letitia and induced
her to take the farm from him. But she did not
take away the mill. Carter Gray was so popular that
although a dissenter he was appointed a magistrate.
The lord lieutenant of the county has the recommendation
for magistrates and had declared against a dissenter,
but Lord John Russell is supposed to have been in Mr.
Gray’s favor. “Lord John was a great liberal,” added
my acquaintance. “Until his persevering action in Parliament
the dissenters had a hard time of it.”</p>

<p class="tb">In the English village I describe, I called at the
modest residence of the dissenting minister. He had
studied at the Baptist Theological Seminary in London.
I found him to be interested in several of our home
authors. Among his books were the complete works of
Ralph Waldo Emerson (London: Bell &amp; Daldy). He
said that there is no one he honors more than Emerson,
except, perhaps, their own Carlyle. He said that he
had in his theological library Channing’s works and
another man’s, Beecher,—Ward Beecher. “I have a great
admiration for that man.” He had Lowell’s poems, and
rejoiced in Lowell. He spoke of the “Biglow Papers,”
and of the pious editor’s creed, repeating,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I du believe in principle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But oh! I du in interest.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>TAXES AND TITHES.</h3>

<p>The rates for the poor, for repair of roads, for police
(for there is a policeman in every village), and for the
county prison amounted in the parish I speak of to about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
two shillings and sixpence in the pound of the assessed
annual value of the land. As the pound is twenty shillings,
the assessment consequently is over twelve per cent.</p>

<p>The burden of supporting the poor, while much lighter
than in Ireland, must be far heavier than in our country.
Huntingdonshire is one of the smallest counties in England.
In 1871 it contained less than seventy thousand
people, and at the time of my visit had four unions or
poor-houses. But this does not altogether represent the
amount of poverty. In another farming region, I understood
that the farm-laborer, even though he be sober,
honest, and industrious, seldom or never lays by enough
to support his family in his age, but becomes partially or
entirely dependent on parish relief. But out-door relief
in the parish I have been describing, and perhaps in England
generally, is granted only to the aged; young people
must go into “The House.” There they pick oakum
and work garden ground. Children are put out at fourteen
or earlier, if they have passed in the school “the
fourth standard.” No child is allowed during the period
that school is open to go to work under the age of ten.</p>

<p class="tb">Tithes in this parish of Haddenham cum Stonea
average about one dollar and eighty cents to the acre.
If there were sufficient land attached to the rectory for
the income to support Mr. Rounce there would be no
tithes, but there are only sixty acres of glebe land, and
the living is worth, as I have stated, about six thousand
dollars yearly. The sixty acres of glebe land bring in
about five hundred dollars, hence the remainder is to be
raised by tithes.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Jackson, the carpenter with whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
I boarded. He was a dissenter, and they attended the
chapel. He rented, however, six acres of land, and his
tithes to the English Church were about ten dollars
yearly.</p>

<p>Formerly Quakers resisted the payment of tithes. A
friend told me that his father, uncle, and grandfather
were imprisoned in the county jail for non-payment.
When he himself farmed three hundred and twenty-two
acres, he paid five hundred and twenty pounds rent and
one hundred and twenty pounds for tithes. This money
was generally seized from him. He had land in three
parishes, and numerous warrants were out against him.
The officers would come with cart or wagon, and seize
his grain while he was threshing. In his father’s time
they would have green boughs, and stick one into every
tenth shock of grain or hay. But Friends have now
given up this contest, and pay tithes quietly. Apparently
he did not think them burdensome.</p>

<p class="tb">Tolls on roads were abolished in England only a few
years ago, and the expense now falls on the landholder.
We do not often see in our country such a road as connects
the two villages which I describe under the name
Haddenham and Stonea. It is a highway in splendid
form and order, with a wide grassy margin and a ditch
on each side. On one is a wide, gravelled footpath, and
fine green hedges separate the road from the fields.</p>

<h3>SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>There are three schools in these two villages. One of
them is a Dame school, or an unpretending private one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
which I did not visit; but the two principal ones
deserve attention from the students of our institutions
and of English ones. They are public schools, although
people pay for tuition. That in Haddenham is a National
school, that in Stonea a British school. In the
former, Mr. Rounce, the rector, is manager, and the
doctrines of the Church of England are taught. The
other, the British school, is under charge of a board, or
of a committee, of which several members are dissenters.</p>

<p>I first visited the National or Church of England
school. Eighty-one names were upon the roll and fifty
in attendance at one of my visits. (Some little ones
were at work in the fields, weeding, or perhaps hay-making.)
Pupils may enter at two years. The printed
form issued by government asks, “How many have you
under three?” And by the obligatory law the schools
can claim them at five.</p>

<p>Upon the walls of the school were several maps, a
large printed copy of the Creed, large tablets of the
Commandments, and little pictures from the Bible, with
perhaps a few from natural history. The blackboard
was an insignificant one, about four feet square. I observed
the small amount of blackboard surface provided,
and the youngest teacher said that in the British schools
there is blackboard on the sides of the room.</p>

<p>There was in the school a little picture of the royal
family. “We teach them loyalty to the queen,” said
one of the teachers.</p>

<p>Connected with the school was an infant department.
Here the blackboard measured about one foot by eighteen
inches. There were a few objects upon the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
but there seemed to me a general bareness of appliances
for instruction.</p>

<p>This school is an endowed one, having fourteen acres
of land; it has always been a National school, or one
where the principles of the Church of England are taught.
Five years ago it became a government school,—<i>i.e.</i>, it
has become an “efficient elementary school” under the
government; it is examined by a government inspector,
and for children coming up to the government standard
the school receives a small sum in payment on each.
These “results,” as they are called, all pass into the rector’s
hands, as manager of the school, to be appropriated
either toward the payment of teachers or for school apparatus.
Here all apparatus is paid for from this fund.</p>

<p>For instruction of children farmers pay four cents a
week for each child; others two. The parish pays for
pauper children. The amount of the endowment and
the government grant are not even enough, I am told,
to pay the principal; and the two assistants are paid by
the rector.</p>

<p>National or, in other words, Church of England schools
are also visited by a diocesan inspector, appointed by the
bishop to report their progress in “Holy Scripture,
Prayer-Book, and Catechism.” This school having been
reported very good last year, a gift of about seven dollars
was made to the teacher and monitor.</p>

<p>Instruction must be given for four hundred sessions
yearly, equivalent to two hundred days.</p>

<p>Some teachers in government schools receive pensions,
but as the number of pensions in England and Scotland
is limited to two hundred and seventy, there are not
enough for all. Before leaving this school, I may mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
that I made some inquiry about the chapel, which
stood not far off. One of the teachers answered, “I
know nothing about dissent; I never go into those places.”</p>

<p class="tb">The school in the other village of Stonea (Haddenham
cum Stonea) was called the British school, and was much
larger, having one hundred and forty pupils. The room
was large and well lighted, and there was an appearance
of thrift and animation in the scholars. It is not under
the control of the Church of England; neither are members
of that church excluded from its management. It
is managed by a committee of seven, of whom two or
three are members of the church. The services of the
committee, including the secretary, are gratuitous. The
school has an income of three hundred dollars, drawn
from a gift in land, made many years ago for the free
education of village-born children. This sum is supplemented
by subscription. This school also is visited by
the government inspector, and a certain sum is paid, according
to the attainments of the children, called, as I
have said, “the results.” The committee decides what
shall be done with this sum.</p>

<p>The school funds are further supplemented thus: In
the village the children pay two cents a week. Those
out of the village pay, if laborers, four cents for the first
child, and two for each of the others. Persons of means
pay twelve cents a week, but there are very few such.</p>

<p>Members of the Society of Friends, “who have always
been active in education,” raised a general subscription
for building a new school-house, and the
government added a grant; “the government would
always thus assist to build a public school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span></p>

<p>Religious instruction is not obligatory here as in the
National school; it is at the option of the committee,
who have decided to have Bible instruction for the first
hour in the morning. The government allows any
one who brings a written request from his father to
absent himself from this instruction. No such case has
ever arisen here. It may in towns where there are Free-thinkers
and Catholics.</p>

<p>This school is plentifully supplied with blackboards.
The principal difference that I observed in instruction
between this and some public ones I have known at
home was in arithmetic. A series of six small practical
arithmetics was in use. At the close of each were
examination questions. Here is the last in Standard
6, the highest: “If 27 men build 54 roods of garden
wall in 26 days, how many roods will 32 men, working
equally well, build in 39 days?” Perhaps twice in a
week they have mental arithmetic. Here is the last
question in Standard 5, mental: “A yard at half a
guinea an inch?”</p>

<p>These elementary schools in villages are mixed, or for
both sexes; in towns they are not. By the act of 1870,
a pupil must enter school at five (education being obligatory),
and remain until thirteen. There are, however,
six standards in the school, and a pupil who wishes to
go to work sooner may demand a certificate if he has
finished the fourth standard, and is not obliged to finish
the term.</p>

<p>I asked of one of the teachers or monitors in this British
school whether she had ever visited the other, the National
school. She replied that she would not like to
go there. She seemed to fear that she would be thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
a spy. The rector does not visit this British school.
“Unfortunately,” said one to me, “in our country the
Church of England people think themselves above
everybody else, and unless they can have the management
of affairs will have nothing to do with them.
The rector feels that he ought to have the management
of the school, and is sore on that point; but it has been
a successful school for forty years, and nothing that the
rector can do can injure it.”</p>

<p>I asked, “Has the teacher of the National school
ever visited this one?”</p>

<p>“No; where the rector does not go, his people may
not. We have tried every means to unite with them,
but without effect. All the exertions here are for the
good of the school, but in the other village for the good
of the church. They want a teacher who will serve
them in the school, the Sunday-school, and the choir.”</p>

<p>But on this parish controversy a few words were
spoken to me by a diligent member of the Established
Church. He said, “The rector thinks he ought to be
one of the trustees of the British school, as a bequest
upon which it is in part founded says that the clergyman
of the parish shall be one of the trustees, but they
say that they will wait until the trusteeship is vacant.”
The place was filled, I understood, by the former rector,
who, as I have said, was described as a tiny little man;
a clever, very learned man; a stanch liberal in politics,
over eighty years of age.</p>

<p class="tb">Afterwards, in Manchester, I met a person who spoke
further on the subject of public schools. I give what he
said, as drawn from my notes, on his own authority; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
although it does not especially concern the parish of
Haddenham cum Stonea, yet it does the general subject
of English schools.</p>

<p>He said that the members of the Church of England
support National or Church of England schools. The
Roman Catholics support their own. The dissenters support
unsectarian British schools, which receive all denominations.
There is yet another class of elementary
ones, namely, School Board schools. These boards are
elected by the rate- or tax-payers. The schools are established
in districts where there are not enough others
to educate the children. It not unfrequently happens that
a Church school or a British one which is unable to support
itself, in spite of the government assistance before
described, is turned over by its conductors to the school
board. In Manchester this board has now in its schools
about two-fifths of the children.</p>

<p>If the board wishes to establish a new school it has
first to obtain leave from the committee on education of
the Privy Council, belonging to the general government
or to the ministry for the time being. The policy of the
government is to prevent school boards from supplanting
the sectarian schools; they are only allowed to supplement
them, and no matter how poor the sectarian
school may be, there is no way of getting it closed so
long as Her Majesty’s inspector pronounces it efficient.
The reports of the inspectors show that Board schools
are improving more rapidly than others.</p>

<p>When by the act of 1870 these schools were first established
they were regarded by the conductors of the
others with contempt, especially by those of the Roman
Catholic and Church schools; but such has been their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
progress within this brief period that they are now regarded
with jealousy.</p>

<p>As to the prices charged by the Board schools, they
must submit the payment of their proposed fees to the
committee of Privy Council. The others mentioned
may charge up to eighteen cents a week for instruction.</p>

<p>If a private school be inefficient, the school board
may prosecute the parents of the children. But this
applies to schools which teach pupils at less than eighteen
cents per week; such as the old “Dame schools,” now
nearly extinct, at least in Manchester.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<p>Ways of living in England differ from those I am
accustomed to in points before mentioned, such as the
large number of meals, and the short hours of farm
labor. A Lancashire youth complained that they
clemmed or starved him in America on three meals a day.
In this rural region those who can afford it take four,
tea being in the afternoon and supper before going to
bed.</p>

<p>Of articles of furniture I especially noticed two. One
of them, which is nearly universal in England and Ireland,
is entirely out of date where I live. It is the old-fashioned
dressing-glass, which swings in a frame and
stands upon a table. I do not remember its absence in
any house that could afford it. Another article that I
saw more rarely, but in both England and Ireland, was
the canopy over the head of the bed. Of one I saw the
framework was of heavy wood, with curtains at the side
running on rings. A straight piece of the same material<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
hung down behind the head of the bed. At my hotel
in Cork this canopy was of faded blue damask; at the
carpenter’s in the village, of faded red, and above
trimmed with heavy woollen fringe. A handsomer one
was on my bed in London. Perhaps this canopy is all
that remains of curtains that formerly surrounded the
bed.</p>

<p class="tb">I have spoken of mangling as used in England. Mrs.
Jackson, the carpenter’s wife, hired a woman to come
to the house once a month to wash. It took them both
two days to do it, and Mrs. Jackson paid regularly about
twenty-four cents a day; or if the woman made a long
day, twenty-eight. In harvest she must pay higher.
(When Benton, the farmer with whom I boarded, heard
me speak of our paying washer-women here seventy-five
cents or a dollar, he said that before he would pay so
much he would turn his shirt or throw it into a pool
and give it a slop wash.)</p>

<p>After Mrs. Jackson’s clothes were dried she took them
to a neighbor’s to be mangled. The mangle is not unlike
a great wringer with rollers; and if the clothes are
damp, it rolls them smooth. Mrs. Jackson’s neighbor
allowed people to do their own mangling at “tuppence
ha’penny or thruppence,” according to the size of the
basket. This is a great saving of fuel, and Mrs. Jackson
said that they look just as well.</p>

<p class="tb">Active sports seem to have more prominence in
England than in our own country. At Haddenham
I called toward evening at the teacher’s, and found
that he had gone to play cricket. And young Benton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
son of the farmer, had gone too. He seemed actively
engaged in business, but one morning he was up early,
as he wished to go that day to a cricket-match, eleven
miles distant. At Benton’s, mention was made of one
of their relatives, who had been much given to cricket
and other sports, and who had gone to Canada. He
said that if he had worked as hard in England as he did
in America, he would have got on there.</p>

<p>Yet Benton, the farmer, thinks it strange that I do
not want to see the races in their county town.</p>

<p>Skating is a favorite amusement. On a meadow near
by, which is always covered with water in the winter,
they have skating-matches. On the fens are great
skaters, I hear, and people come from all parts to compete
with them.</p>

<p class="tb">One of the strongest evidences of a higher state of
civilization than ours (and perhaps of a different climate)
is that Mrs. Benton, the farmer’s wife, told me that she
had never seen a man without stockings in her life. All
the children in the British school (I think in both
schools) wore both shoes and stockings, and some woollen
stockings, though the month was July. However, the
teacher said that in the north of England children go
barefoot; and I had just come from Ireland, where I
had heard of laborers’ children that passed the winter
without stockings or shoes.</p>

<p class="tb">In our own country I had read or heard of English
farmers who rode in handsome vehicles, who wore silk
hats, who occasionally drank champagne. But great
farmers, cultivating hundreds of acres, must be capitalists.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Of course there will be less luxury in straitened
times. I heard, however, that a respectable farmer
would never go to church, or especially to a funeral,
places where he wished to show respect, without a silk
hat. At market he might wear one of felt or straw.</p>

<p>Other matters being equal, the retired farmer is more
nearly one of the gentry than the retired tradesman. In
the parish of Haddenham cum Stonea, where I dwelt,
perhaps the only person that came within that charmed
circle, the nobility and gentry, was the rector of the
church, and he did not stand high in it. I heard of the
daughters of one clergyman who invited another to dine,
and told him that it would be a nice party, “nobody
who did not keep a footman or lady’s-maid.” If a distinguished
dissenting minister like Spurgeon should
come to a country town to lecture, in all probability he
would not be socially noticed by the nobility and gentry.</p>

<p>A young Englishwoman told me that her sister, who
lived in our country, said that the Americans are more
polite than the English; and two Englishmen who had
travelled here spoke of the many attentions which they
had received.</p>

<p class="tb">In this region of eastern England villages are found
bearing names derived from the Saxon. I have called
this parish Haddenham cum Stonea. The syllable ham
comes from the Saxon, and means a dwelling, hence our
word home. The syllable <i>ea</i>, in Stonea, means water.</p>

<p>Said the dissenting minister, “There is no part of
England where the people are freer and more independent
in thought than in these eastern counties of
Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntingdon, and parts of Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
and Lincoln.” And he inferred that from these counties
our Pilgrim fathers must have sprung. About fifty
miles from the parish I describe lies the city of Boston,
from which came Mr. Cotton, the preacher in whose
honor our own city of Boston was named.</p>

<p>“The last struggles of the Anglo-Saxons against the
Normans were in these counties,” said one. “At Ely,
then an island in the centre of the fens, Hereward fortified
himself for a while, and made the last struggles
against the Normans.”</p>

<p>An acquaintance who had visited America remarked
to me that the district of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire,
where we were, is typically agricultural; that
there are very few resident gentry; therefore the social
life of this region more resembles that of the United
States than does that of most other sections of England.</p>

<p>In this county of Huntingdonshire was born Oliver
Cromwell, and at its town of St. Ives he lived. In this
section he probably raised his celebrated soldiers called
Ironsides. But the conservatives of England do not
admire Cromwell. About twenty years ago in his
native county it was found impossible to raise means to
erect his statue.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p class="tb">On this side of the county are no county families
bearing the title Esquire. ⸺ Farrar, Esq., north of
us, is a great landed proprietor, with an income of about
two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars. The Earl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
of S. and the Duke of M. are also large landed proprietors.
The Duke of Bedford owns an estate in
Thorny Fen of perhaps ten to fifteen thousand acres.
My friend who tells me this thinks that the estate, however,
is in another county from this. He understands
that the duke expects each tenant to take one thousand
acres and to keep a hunter. The duke is a liberal in
politics.</p>

<p>The subject of politics was alluded to in the opening
of this article, in the remarks of Jackson, the carpenter.
Another acquaintance said, “If you go to a nobleman or
great landed proprietor to rent a farm, you must be deferential
and, as a general thing, you must vote on his side.
If a man is a liberal, he must go under a liberal landlord;
and if a tory, under a tory. Perhaps one-third
of the House of Lords are liberals,” he added.</p>

<p>Benton, the farmer, did not tell me his political opinions.
He said that the ballot is secret. But he added
that a man’s political opinions have not now anything
to do with renting the land.</p>

<p>But a person whom I afterward met in Manchester
said that the agricultural districts were in the main
thoroughly tory, the farmers being dependent on the
landlords. He added that the late Lord Derby used to
say, “Tell me what the landlords are and I will tell you
what the vote will be.”</p>

<p class="tb">Haddenham cum Stonea has declined in population.
In 1840 the parish had nearly one thousand four hundred
inhabitants. It now has about one thousand.
Many went to America; now many go north into the
manufacturing regions. Nor are these two villages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
alone in this. Jackson, the carpenter, told me of one
where he had lived which, at the last census, had three
hundred and thirty people. Twenty years back, he said,
it had over five hundred.</p>

<p>Public-houses are numerous in these villages. They
are mostly simple ale-houses, with such titles as the
Three Horse-Shoes, the Rose and Crown, the Three
Jolly Butchers. I counted at least eleven in a village
of less than seven hundred people.</p>

<p>The wages of a farm-laborer here are under two
dollars and seventy-five cents a week, and he boards
himself. The cottagers on the farm where I boarded
got their houses free and a rood of ground in which to
plant potatoes. While at Haddenham I visited a friend
in a near village, who took me to ride upon the fens,
and her husband particularly desired her to show me
some cottages, or laborers’ houses, that he had built.
The point that I was especially to observe was the rooms
provided for sleeping, there being a bedroom down-stairs
and two or more above. On this subject I spoke
to Mrs. Benton, the farmer’s wife, who said that the
laborers here have generally a kitchen, I believe a better
room, and two chambers. She admitted that the boys
and girls have to sleep in the same room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton said that if the laborer’s wife, who has a
number of young children, is kind and considerate of
her husband, she will try to provide him a bit of meat
daily, but it will be but a little bit; and the children
will not taste meat oftener than once a week.</p>

<p>As I have before intimated, hours of labor are easy,—farm
hands getting half an hour for lunch, and an hour
for dinner. (But I cannot say whether this lunch-time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
is allowed at other than harvest.) In hay and harvest
they work overtime, and are paid for overwork.</p>

<p>Fruit-picking was going on while I was at Haddenham.
In fruit-gathering times, when the wives and
boys get out a little, meat may be more plentiful in
laborers’ houses. There is a great press at fruit-gathering.
The people go out in gangs about six or seven
o’clock, and return about seven. The wages are about
thirty-two cents a day. A market for the fruit is furnished
by the manufacturing regions, where farm produce
is more scarce.</p>

<p>At Haddenham I heard that after harvest they have
a thanksgiving festival. There is a village flower-show
in the rectory grounds and a public tea. They deck
the church with wheat, barley, oats, beans, grapes,
apples, and pears, and have a service in the evening.
A collection is taken up for the county hospital, which
is supported almost entirely by voluntary subscription.</p>

<p>To return once more to education. It is now compulsory,
as I have said; but a friend estimated that of
the people over thirty, a large proportion could not read
and write.</p>

<h3>PECULIARITIES OF SPEECH.</h3>

<p>To us that one by which the English drop the letter
h where it belongs, and put it on where it does not, is
one of the most striking; as, Harable land is ’eavier
taxed; my huncle is not very ’ealthy.</p>

<p>Two ways of speaking that are called Yankee with us
are found here; one is the sharp <i>ou</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span></p>

<p>“Please tell me,” I inquired, “where Mr. G.’s house
is.”</p>

<p>“It’s the last hayoose in tayoon; a big hayoose,” answered
the boy.</p>

<p>The other “Yankee” peculiarity is dropping the letter
r. School-children said ’osses for horses. Buttah was
said for butter, and Hemmingford sounded like Emmenfauld.
A woman spoke of a certain Mr. Halbut.
I had thought that his name was Wiseman. Yes; Mr.
Halbut (Albert) Wiseman.</p>

<p>Comin’ I heard for coming; they used to say shay-house
for chaise-house; and I am told that in Norfolk
they say <i>du</i> and <i>tu</i> for do and to.</p>

<p>The carpenter’s wife said, “The bread is silly,”
meaning heavy.</p>

<p>A spinney is a grove.</p>

<p>Laboring men call a lunch a dockey; and in another
neighborhood a beaver.</p>

<p>Said an innkeeper, “The people come to flit them,”—to
help them move.</p>

<p>Frequently “I dare say” becomes <i>dessay</i>, or <i>I’d say</i>.</p>

<p>We say to-day; they also say to-year. And when it
begins to thaw, they say the weather is ungiving, it
ungives.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PENNSYLVANIA GERMAN DIALECT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The “Pennsylvania Dutch,” which is spoken over a large portion
of our own State, and is also heard in Maryland, Virginia,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, is not divided into dialects as are the
languages of many European countries, but seems to be nearly
homogeneous. The following specimen was taken from the lips of
a working-woman born in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, of
German descent, but who learned most of her “Dutch” in the
State of Maryland. She now lives in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
An English article was read to her; and with some
little difficulty she turned it into the version given. This version
was submitted to a learned gentleman born in the eastern part of
this State, but now living in Lancaster, and he declared it to be a
good specimen of Pennsylvania German. I have abbreviated it,
and give the English first, so that the difficulty may be observed
which the translator found in the version.</p>

<p>“At Millville, New Jersey, about noon, while everybody in town
was going to dinner, a deer came dashing down through the main
street, and right behind it followed a dozen dogs, barking the
loudest they knew how. Every dog on the line of the chase joined
in, so that when the edge of the town was reached there were
nearly fifty dogs after the deer. One solitary horseman caught on
to the procession before it left town, and he was soon followed by
a score of others, and inside of half an hour there were only women
and factory hands left in the town. The deer got into the woods
and escaped. A hound, which a merchant sent to Philadelphia
for on Thursday, brought the deer to bay, and the merchant’s son
fired the fatal shot.”</p>

<p>“<i>An Millville, New Jersey, about Mitdog, wie all die Leit in
der Stadt zu Mittag gange sin, en Hayrsch is darrich die main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
Schtross schprunge, und recht hinne noch ein dutzet Hund noch
schprunge, und hen so laut gejolt als sie hen könne. All die Hund
in der Schtadt sind oof die Geschpoor und sin noch; so wie sie an
die End von der Schtadt sin der ware about fufzig Hund am Hayrsch
noch. Ein ehnzige Reiter ist noch eh sie aus der Schtadt kumme
sind und es ware gly zwanzig meh, und in weniger als en Halb-stund
da war Niemand meh in der Schtadt als Wipesleit und die factory
Hendt. Der Hayrsch ist in der Busch kumme und sie hen ihn verlore.
En Houns voo ein Merchant in Philadelphia geschickt hat
dafore, hat den Hayrsch schtill schteh mache; und der Merchant
sei Sohn hat ihn dote schosse.</i>”</p>

<p>But although the Pennsylvania German is not divided into the
great number of dialects or varieties found in Europe (I hear that
there are about fifty in little Switzerland), yet there are differences
here in the spoken dialect. While visiting at the house of a
gentleman born in Lehigh County, but living in Lebanon, the following
were pointed out to me. In Lehigh a lantern is a <i>lutzer</i>;
in Lebanon, <i>lattern</i>. In the former the word for orchard is <i>boongart</i>;
in the latter, <i>bomegarte</i>. Meadow is <i>Schwamm</i> in the
former, and <i>Viss</i> in the latter. The adverb <i>orrick</i> (<i>arg</i>) is very
much used in Pennsylvania German; but a clergyman coming to
live in Lebanon County was reproved by some of his plain friends
for its use. Perhaps it is nearly synonymous with our <i>darned</i>,—“That’s
darned cheap.” Der <i>Arge</i> in the Bible is the evil one.</p>

<p>Mr. Weiser, of the Reformed Church, finds differences in adjoining
counties. Thus, in Berks a set of bars in a fence is <i>en
Falder</i>; in Montgomery, <i>E’fahrt</i> (or a place to drive through).
In Lehigh they say of a drunken man, “<i>Er hat e Kischt ah</i>”
(he carries a chest); but this is not heard in the near parts of
Montgomery. Tomatoes are sometimes, I think, called <i>Goomeranze</i>
in Allentown, and in Bucks County <i>Boomeranze</i> (from
<i>Pomeranze</i>, an orange); but this is not heard in Lancaster County.</p>

<p>A learned German in Philadelphia says that several different
dialects have flowed like streams into Pennsylvania,—one the
Palatinate, another the Suabian, a third Allemanian, a fourth
Swiss; and Prof. Dubbs, of Franklin and Marshall College,
Lancaster, but born in Allentown, finds in the region with which
he is familiar, east of the Susquehanna, three plainly marked
sub-dialects. The one east of the Schuylkill is marked by the
diminutive <i>chen</i> in the place of <i>lein</i>. In that district a little pig<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
is called <i>Säuche</i>, and west of the Schuylkill <i>Säulie</i> (for <i>Säulein</i>).
A third sub-dialect, he says, is peculiar to some of the sects of
Lancaster County. It is probably of Swiss origin, and is marked
by a broad drawl. (The late Prof. Haldeman remarked that
in our dialect the perfect is used for the imperfect tense, as in
Swiss; so that for “ich sagte” (I said) we have “ich hab ksaat”
(gesagt), and for “ich hatte” (I had) we have “ich hab kat”
(gehabt)).</p>

<p>(The following excellent remarks on the Pennsylvania dialect
are taken from an article in the <i>Mercersburg Review</i> by Prof.
Stahr, now also of Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster.
I have made some trifling alterations, mostly in parenthesis.)</p>

<p>“It is of course impossible in our present limits to specify all
the peculiarities of Pennsylvania German, so as to give an adequate
idea of its form to those who are not familiar with it. We
may, however, state a few general principles, which will enable
any one conversant with High German to read and understand
the dialect without difficulty. In the first place it must be borne
in mind that the letters have the <i>South German</i> sound: <i>a</i> has the
broad sound like the English <i>aw</i>; <i>st</i> and <i>sp</i> whenever they occur
sound broad, like <i>scht</i> and <i>schp</i>, etc. Secondly, letters are commuted
or changed. Instead of the proper sound of the modified
vowel or <i>Umlaut ō</i>, we find the sound of the German <i>ē</i> or the
English <i>ā</i>, and instead of <i>ü</i> we find <i>ie</i> or <i>i</i>, equivalent to the
English <i>i</i> in <i>machine</i>, or the same shortened as in pin. Instead of
the proper sound of <i>eu</i>, we have the German <i>ei</i> or the English <i>ī</i>.
Instead of <i>au</i>, particularly when it undergoes modification in
inflections, we have broad <i>a</i> or <i>aa</i> in the unmodified, and <i>ä</i> or <i>āā</i>
in the modified, form. Thus we have <i>Baam</i> for <i>Baum</i>, and <i>Bääm’</i>
for <i>Baüme</i>; <i>laafe’</i> for <i>laufen</i>, and <i>laaft</i> or <i>lääft</i> for <i>laüft</i>. The
diphthong ei is often changed into long <i>e</i> or <i>ee</i>. Thus for <i>Stein</i>
we have <i>Stee’</i> (pronounced Shtay), for <i>Bein</i>, <i>Bee’</i>, for <i>Eid</i> we have
<i>Eed</i>, for <i>Leid</i>, <i>Leed</i>. <i>A</i> is often changed into <i>o</i>, as <i>Johr</i> for <i>Jahr</i>,
<i>Hoor</i> for <i>Haar</i>; <i>i</i> is changed into <i>e</i>, as <i>werd</i> for <i>wird</i> (<i>Es wird
Schlimm</i> is spoken <i>Schvate schlimm</i>), <i>Hert</i> for <i>Hirt</i>, etc. Consonants
are also frequently changed; <i>b</i> into <i>w</i> (<i>Bievel</i> is heard for
Bibel), <i>p</i> into <i>b</i>, <i>t</i> into <i>d</i>, etc. Thirdly, words are shortened by
dropping the terminations, especially <i>n</i> of the infinitive or generally
after <i>e</i>. Prefixes are frequently contracted, so also compound
words. Thus instead of <i>werden</i>, <i>folgen</i>, <i>fangen</i>, we have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
<i>werre’</i>, <i>folge’</i>, <i>fange’</i>; <i>einmal</i> becomes <i>emol</i>; <i>nicht mehr</i>, <i>nimme</i>,
etc. Fourthly, the Pennsylvania dialect uses High German
words in a different sense. Thus for <i>Pferd</i>, horse, we have <i>Gaul</i>,
which in High German means a heavy farm-horse or an old horse;
<i>gleiche</i>, from the High German <i>gleichen</i>, to resemble, means in
the Pennsylvania dialect, to like; <i>gucke’</i>, from High German
<i>gucken</i>, to peep, to pry, means to look. Finally, we find English
words introduced in their full form, either with or without
German prefixes and modifications; e.g., <i>Store</i> (Schtore), <i>Rüles</i>,
<i>Cäpers</i>, <i>Circumstänces</i>, <i>trävele</i>, <i>stärte</i>, <i>fixe</i>, <i>fighte</i>.</p>

<p>“Nouns have scarcely any changes of form, except to distinguish
singular and plural. These, where they exist, are the same
as in High German. One of the most striking peculiarities is
this: the genitive case is never used to indicate possession, the
dative is used in connection with a possessive pronoun. Thus
instead of <i>Der Hut des Mannes</i> (the hat of the man) we find <i>Dem
Mann sei’ Hut</i> (to the man his hat).... The definite article is
used for <i>dieser</i>, <i>diese</i>, <i>dieses</i> (this), and <i>seller</i>, <i>selle</i>, <i>sell</i>, for <i>jener</i>,
<i>jene</i>, <i>jenes</i> (that). The adverb <i>wo</i> is used instead of the relatives
<i>welcher</i>, <i>welche</i>, <i>welches</i>.</p>

<p>“In inflecting pronouns, <i>mir</i> is used instead of <i>wir</i> (us). The
verb has no imperfect tense; the perfect is always used for it in
Pennsylvania German. (And it will be observed, I think, that
those accustomed to speaking the dialect will use the perfect thus
in English.)</p>

<p>“From <i>wollen</i> we have: <i>Ich will</i>, <i>du witt</i>, <i>er will</i>, <i>mir wolle’</i>,
<i>ihr wolle’</i>, <i>sie wolle’</i>; and from <i>haben</i>: <i>Ich hab</i>, <i>du hoscht</i>, <i>er hot</i>,
<i>mir hen</i> (from han, haben), <i>ihr hen</i>, <i>sie hen</i>.”</p>

<p class="tb">The number of writers in the dialect is becoming numerous.
There are Mr. Zimmermann and Dr. Bruner, of Berks County,
Rev. F. J. F. Schantz, originally of Lehigh, and Rev. Eli Keller
and Mr. Henninger of the same; also Miss Bahn and Mr. H. L.
Fisher, of York County. The most popular writer is the late
Henry Harbaugh, of the Reformed Church, whose poems are
collected under the title <i>Harbaugh’s Harfe</i>. Among them the
favorite is <i>Das alt Schulhaus an der Krick</i>. (The old school-house
on the creek.) In publishing this volume, the English words introduced
after the manner of our Pennsylvania Germans have
been generally replaced by German, so that it is not a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
specimen of the spoken language. Here follow a few lines from
Harbaugh’s <i>Heimweh</i>, or Homesickness:</p>

<p class="noindent">The most witty prose articles that I have met are some in Wollenweber’s
<i>Gemälde aus dem Pennsylvanischen Volkleben</i>. (Pictures
of Pennsylvania Life.)</p>

<p>Mr. E. H. Rauch (Pit Schwefflebrenner) accommodates himself
to the great number of our “Dutch” people who do not read
German by writing the dialect phonetically, in this manner:
“<i>Der klea meant mer awer, sei net recht g’sund for er kreisht ols
so greisel-heftict orrick (arg) in der nacht. De olt Lawbucksy
behawpt es is was mer aw gewocksa heast, un meant mer set braucha

me not to be quite well, for he cries so dreadfully in the night.
Old Mrs. Lawbucks maintains that he is what we call grown (enlargement
of the liver), and thinks that I should powwow for it.
She says that there was an old woman in Apple-butter town who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
knew how to drive away the growth with words, and who has too
an ointment that she makes with goose-fat.)</p>

<p>I have already stated that our Pennsylvania dialect has been
thought to be formed from different European sources; but Mr.
H. L. Fisher, of York, has lately shown me a collection of Nadler’s
poems in the Palatinate dialect, which, he says, more nearly resemble
our idiom than anything else which he has seen. Also at
Allentown, Mr. Dubbs, of the Reformed Church, has mentioned
a collection which he thinks resembles much our Pennsylvania
German. It is the poems of Ludwig Schandein, in the Westrich
dialect. These are both dialects of the Rhenish Palatinate, the
former of the district on the Rhine, the latter of the western or
more mountainous part. And as the Germans coming into Pennsylvania
were at one time called Palatines, it is not remarkable
that these Palatinate dialects resemble ours. Here is a specimen
of the eastern or lowland dialect:</p>

<p>Various estimates have been given me of the numbers speaking
the dialect in different parts of our State. Thus a lawyer in York
County, beyond the Susquehanna, says that there are still witnesses
coming to court, natives of the county, who do not speak
English, and whose testimony is translated by an interpreter.
Crossing the Susquehanna easterly, we come to my own county,
Lancaster. My own neighborhood, near the Pennsylvania Central
Railway, is much Anglicized. The southern part of the
county is greatly “English,” but as I was riding lately in the
north, on the railway which connects Reading in Berks, to Columbia
in Lancaster, a conductor estimated that along the forty-six
miles of the railway about nine out of ten of the travellers can
speak German. In Reading I am told in a lawyer’s office that
three-fourths of the women who come in to do business speak
“Pennsylvania Dutch.” My tavern-keeper says that many come
to his house, born in the county, who cannot speak English. Another
lawyer estimates that of the country people born in Berks
County, three-fourths would rather speak Pennsylvania German
than English; and another thinks that in the rural districts of the
county from one-half to two-thirds prefer to speak the dialect, although
perhaps half of these can talk English. Another person
says that when there is a circus or county fair at Reading, which
draws the farmers’ families, you hardly hear English, for the
store-keepers accommodate themselves to the visitors. One of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
friends, born in Germany, says that she saw at a forge in Berks
County colored people, men, women, and children, that could not
speak English; they spoke Pennsylvania German. If, now, we
pass northerly to Lehigh County, we come to “Pennsylvania
Dutch” land par <i>excellence</i>, for in no other county of our State
are the people so nearly of unmixed German origin. I am told of
Allentown, the county seat, with a population of about nineteen
thousand, that Pennsylvania German, “Dutch,” is the prevailing
language. A lawyer estimates that more than one-fourth of its
inhabitants do not speak English if they can help it, and a considerable
number in town, born in this region, do not speak English
at all. Of the county, a physician says that three-fourths of the
people speak Pennsylvania German more easily than English, and
another that nearly all the country people would rather speak the
dialect.</p>

<p>East of Lehigh lies another very German county, Northampton.
The county town Easton is, however, connected with New Jersey
by a bridge over the Delaware, and Easton is to a very considerable
degree Anglicized. Easton is the seat of a great Presbyterian institution,
Lafayette College; yet a professor tells me that the Presbyterian
Church cannot overcome the Lutheran and Reformed element.
The Lutheran Church, he says, is very strong. Of the same
county I was told some years ago that the people generally spoke
German, except along the New Jersey line, and that outside of
Easton and Bethlehem three-fourths of the people are Reformed and
Lutheran. At the same period, about nine years ago, a physician
told me that the public-school teachers in the rural parts must
necessarily speak German for the children to obtain ideas, or must
interpret English to them. These counties, with Lebanon, six in
number, are the great German ones, beginning with York on the
southwest, and ending with Northampton on the northeast; but
the Pennsylvania German population is by no means confined to
these counties. It spreads along the cultivated soil like grass.
Adjoining Berks and Lehigh is Montgomery, the northern part of
which is very “Dutch.” Here I visited a preacher of one of our
plain sects, whose great-grandfather came from Germany. But
he, himself, speaks very little or no English, and he employed the
ticket-agent to answer an English letter. One son and his children
live under the same roof, making six generations in Pennsylvania;
but the whole household uses the German dialect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p>It must not be supposed of a large part of the Pennsylvania
Germans that they are unacquainted with pure German. A
simple and pure German they find in the Bible and in their German
newspapers, of which there are several, altogether enjoying a
large circulation. Also, at least in the Reformed and Lutheran
Churches, there are many ministers who preach in pure German.
Yet, when the minister goes to dine with a parishioner, they generally
speak the dialect. The minister who speaks this to his
flock is more popular. They could understand the higher German;
but they say of him when he speaks the dialect, “<i>Er iss
en gemehner Mann</i>” (He is a common, plain man, or one who
doesn’t put on airs.)</p>

<p>A gentleman in Lebanon, born in Berks, told me that he
should be pleased to speak German as it is in the Bible. “But,”
he added, “as soon as a person begins to use pure German here
among his acquaintances the Pennsylvania Dutch will say,
‘<i>Des iss ane Fratz-Hans</i>,’ or a high-flown fellow; or, as it may
be rendered, ‘He’s full of conceit.’”</p>

<p>One of the most amusing things in the dialect is the adopting
and transforming of English words, as “Ich habe en Prediger
<i>entgetscht</i>,”—I have engaged a preacher; “Do hat der <i>Eirisch</i>
gemehnt er wott <i>triede</i>,”—the Irishman thought he would treat;
“Sie henn en guter <i>Tietscher</i> katt, der hot die Kinner vieler
Leut <i>getietscht</i>,”—they had a good teacher, who taught the
children of many people; “Ich will dir’s <i>exsplehne</i>,”—I will
explain it to you; “Er hat mich <i>inweitet</i>,”—he invited me; “Do
hen sie anfange <i>ufzukotte</i> und zu lache,”—then they began to cut
up and laugh. A workman who was tired of waiting for material
said, “Sie hen us nau lang genug ’rum <i>gebaffelt</i>”—they have
baffled or disappointed us long enough.</p>

<p>On the amount of English that is sometimes introduced into the
dialect, a lawyer in Lebanon says that of the Pennsylvania
Dutch which he uses in his political speeches, or in his practice,
fully one-third is English. This specimen was given to me by a
lawyer in Allentown, as the opening of a political speech: “Ich
bin desirous um euch zu explaine die prerogative powers fum
President.” And this a lawyer to his client: “Ich bin certain
das die Opinion was ich den morge geexpress hab, correct war.”</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the idiom, I give some of the
peculiar expressions heard in speaking English. A neighbor told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
me of her daughter’s being invited to a picnic, and added, “I
don’t know what I’ll wear on her.”</p>

<p>Said a tavern-keeper’s wife, “Don’t jine sweeping.” “It’s
time to jine sweeping,” was the reply.</p>

<p>A girl got into a car near Mauch Chunk, and had headache.</p>

<p>“Don’t sit with your back to the engine,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Do you sink?” she asked me. (Do you think so?)</p>

<p>“I guess it will give a gust,” is said in Lancaster County.</p>

<p>“Do you want butter-bread?” (or bread and butter.) “No,
I’d rather have coffee-soup,”—<i>i.e.</i>, bread broken into coffee.</p>

<p>“Mary, come down to the woods.” “I dassent.” She does
not mean that she is afraid, but that she is not permitted, like the
German <i>durfen</i>.</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly used to travel every <i>wich</i> way.”</p>

<p>“A body gets <i>dired</i> if they <i>dravel</i>.”</p>

<p>“Mind Ressler? He was in Sprecher’s still;” or, “Do you
remember Ressler? He used to be employed in Sprecher’s
store.”</p>

<p>“It’s raining a’ready, mother,” or, “Where’s Mrs. M.?”
“She went to bed a’ready.”</p>

<p>“I guess that Mrs. B. does not spend all her income.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t still.”</p>

<p>“She’d rather be married to him <i>as</i> to keep house for him”
(like the German <i>als</i>).</p>

<p>We think those very “Dutch” who say “Sess” for Seth,
“bass-house” for bath-house. Thus it would be, Beslem is in
Norsampton County.</p>

<p>“I’m fetching a pig. I had it bestowed.”</p>

<p>“We’re getting strangers, and I was fetched.” (They are expecting
company at our house, and they sent for me to come home.)</p>

<p>“Mrs. M., how does your garden grow?” “Just so middlin’.”</p>

<p>“Your head is strubly,” means that your hair is tumbled.</p>

<p>A scientific friend, wishing to examine a specimen, said, “Let
me see it once.”</p>

<p>Of the same kind are these: “When we get moved once.”
“You’ll know what it is when you hain’t got no father no more
once.” (This use of <i>once</i> has been alluded to in the text.)</p>

<p>“Mother, don’t be so cross!” “I ought to be cross” (angry).</p>

<p>I do not know that it is “Dutch” to say, “Did you kiss your
<i>poppy</i>?” or, “Barbara, where’s your <i>pap</i>?” (for father).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span></p>

<p>“How are you, Chrissly?” (diminutive of Christian.) “Oh!
I’ve got it so in the back.”</p>

<p>Those who live among Pennsylvania Germans cannot fail to
observe that when they, speaking English, make mention of a
couple, as, “She gave me a couple of peaches,” they do not generally
mean two only. Couple has doubtless to them the same
meaning as the German word <i>Paar</i>, which is defined by Whitney
“a couple, two or three, a few, sundry.”</p>

<p>I cannot tell the deviation of our interjection of pain, <i>Owtch!</i></p>

<p><i>Ok!</i> is doubtless the German <i>Ach!</i> or is it Irish?</p>

<p>And what is the derivation of “<i>Sahdie?</i>” so much used by
children for “Thank you.”</p>

<p>There is a word neither of English nor German origin which
is sometimes used as a salutation by Pennsylvania Germans. It
is familiarly <i>Hottiay</i>. Few would divine to see it thus that it
is the French adieu.</p>

<h3>PROPER NAMES.</h3>

<p>Changes equally remarkable are found in proper names. The
family of my own neighbor Johns was originally Tschantz, as is
more easily perceived by the pronunciation; Johns ending with
the s sound and not the z. The important family in Lancaster
County named Carpenter were Zimmerman when they came in,
the name being translated. But of a family in Berks County,
some are Hunter and some Yäger. Some persons named Bender,
who have removed to California, are there called Painter.</p>

<p>It is surprising in Pennsylvania to hear of persons with Irish
or Scottish names who can scarcely speak English. A gentleman
in Harrisburg told me of one he knew in Dauphin County named
Hamilton (whose father was born in Dublin), and of two others
named Dougherty. I have met in Berks County a person with a
purely Scottish name who spoke of Norsampton County, and of
Souss Reading (not pronouncing the th). But his mother was of
a German family, and “Pennsylvania Dutch” his mother-tongue.</p>

<p>A lawyer in York, with an English name, tells me that his
ancestors came from New England, and settled first in the Wyoming
Valley, but some moved southward, and by intermarriage, to
use, I think, his own expression, became quite Dutchified. He
himself can speak the dialect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<p>Several families with French names are now not to be distinguished
from the Pennsylvania Germans among whom they live
and intermarry. It is said that the Bushongs were once Beauchamp;
then probably the Deshongs were Du Champ. The Shopells
were Chapelle; the Levans perhaps Levin. Delaplaine is
pronounced <i>Dillyplen</i>. There are still Bertolettes, De Bennevilles,
De Turks, De Planks, Philippes, Philippis, and Philippys. Coquelin
has become Cockley and Gockley. These families were perhaps
French Huguenots who sought refuge in Germany, where so
many went on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. From the
Palatinate came very many of our Pennsylvania Germans, and
that state is directly east of France.</p>

<p>But it is also probable that many French names were translated
when their owners removed to Germany. One of my acquaintances
in Philadelphia is a German, born in the Palatinate. She
tells me that her grandfather left France during the revolution.
He was a Mennonite, and named Coquerel; but this was translated
into Hähnchen; so that my friend was a Miss Hähnchen.
Coquerel, Hähnchen, and our English word cockerel are synonymous.</p>

<p>Changes in the names of persons of the same family in Pennsylvania
will be observed. I know a gentleman in Lebanon County
with an English name, who tells me that his mother’s name was
Besore; supposed to have been La Bessieur. The name has also
been spelled Basore, Bashor, and Bayshore. The name Beinbrecht
is said to have gone through these changes; in Philadelphia there
is a Bonbright, in Chambersburg a Bonbrake, and there are Bonebreaks.
In Lancaster County, I hear of a father who writes his
name Bear; but one son is Barr, and another Bair. There is a
large Reformed family in Pennsylvania named Wotring, now
turned into the English Woodring, which was originally the
French Voiturin. Probably within the Reformed German Church
are more French Calvinistic families than in the Lutheran.</p>

<p>Of the Buchanans and Livingstones in our country we might
assume the Scottish origin; but <i>Der Deutsche Pionier</i> tells us that
the German name Buchenhain [meaning Beech grove] has been
changed to Buchanan, and Löwenstein to Livingstone. A more
grievous change is said to have befallen the name Hochmayer or
Hochmier [high steward], for in Virginia it has become Hogmire!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span></p>

<h3>POLITICS.</h3>

<p>One of the most remarkable distinctions between our Pennsylvania
Germans is that which ranges the counties and townships
inhabited by the wehrlos, or peaceable sects, with one political
party; and those where the Reformed and Lutherans are strongest
with the other. We might once have thought that the Democratic
party was the war party; but during the great rebellion the counties
of Berks, Lehigh, and Northampton still remained adherents
of the Democratic party in its opposition to the war. The county
of Montgomery, in the eastern part of the State, is thus divided;
the Mennonites, Schwenkfelders (with Quakers), are almost invariably
Republican; while the strong Democratic townships are
almost entirely Reformed and Lutheran. Of course there are
in all such localities many who do not belong to any religious
body.</p>

<p>A Democratic editor in the same county of Montgomery says
that he does not know a Mennonite or Schwenkfelder who is not
Republican; so also are the great majority of the German Methodists.
He, however, added that the Reformed and Lutherans are
nearly equally divided in politics. But every politician who
knows the people must concede that the counties which are the
stronghold of these two churches are an immense Democratic
stronghold.</p>

<p>Mr. H., of Easton, tells me of a man who stood looking at a
procession in honor of the funeral of Jackson, Harrison, or some
other distinguished person. In the procession were Freemasons,
Odd-Fellows, and other societies. “Oh,” said he, “<i>des ish alle
letz!</i> That is all wrong. There ought to be only two societies,—the
Democrats and the Lutherans. If a man lives up to the principles
of General Jackson and Martin Luther, that is enough.”
He took his boys to delegate or town-meetings. “Now, boys,”
he said, “are you going to vote the Democratic ticket as long as
you live? Always stick to the Democratic party, and carry out
the principles of General Jackson. If you intend to do this, you
can vote for delegates.” (This anecdote is a little injured by the
introduction in the beginning of the name of Harrison, who was
a Whig. But it was given to me by a person of a well-known
Democratic and Lutheran family.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span></p>

<p>A few years ago, in an adjoining county, an adherent of the
Democratic party told me that the word democracy has a magic
sound for the people of Lehigh. “A Democratic parade,” he
added, “can easily be got up in Allentown two miles in length,
composed in a great measure of farmers on horseback; and in
Presidential campaigns sometimes farmers’ daughters also appear
on horseback in the procession. A skilful speaker, generally a
lawyer, who speaks the dialect, and who will frequently introduce
the words democrat and democracy, can lead the crowd. Even if
he do not speak the dialect, if he will introduce those words, he
can bring out the applause of his hearers.”</p>

<p>An acquaintance tells me of a political speaker in Berks County,
that Democratic stronghold. He was telling of <i>die Demokratie</i>,
which he said goes over hill and dale, over the sea, and strikes the
seat from under kings. “And if you ask where that democracy
comes from, they will tell you from Berks County.”</p>

<h3>YANKEES.</h3>

<p>An acquaintance once explained to me the prejudice against
Yankees by telling me how, about fifty years ago or longer, the
tin-peddlers travelled among the innocent Dutch people, cheating
the farmers and troubling the daughters. They were (says he)
tricky, smart, and good-looking. They could tell a good yarn,
and were very amusing, and the goodly hospitable farmers would
take them into their houses and entertain them, and receive a little
tin-ware in payment.</p>

<p>A lawyer in Easton, from the State of New York, says that he
never saw so large a body of people so honestly inclined as the
Pennsylvania Germans. He speaks from a knowledge of the
people of Northampton and Lehigh. They have an especial
dread of the people of New England and New York, from their
having been so terribly victimized by patent-rights’ men. He
adds that they are not a reading people, but by their careful and
slow manner of getting along they really accomplish more than
the people of New England and New York, who, he says, make a
great display, and then frequently compromise with their creditors
by paying fifteen or twenty cents on the dollar. A person present
added of these Pennsylvania Germans that they never headed any
great moral reforms and never drowned witches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span></p>

<p>Another thinks that in his youth the Yankee drovers in Lehigh
County were respected for their acuteness. He adds, however,
that when the “Dutch” call a man a Yankee, it is not near so
opprobrious as to call him a Jew. “But,” says another, “when
a Yankee comes to Reading with patent rights and inventions
they point and say, ‘<i>Do geht en Yoot</i>.’” (There goes a Jew.)
Dr. L., of Lebanon County, says that the “Dutch” idea of a
Yankee is not of one who starts out to cheat for the pleasure of
cheating, but of one who prefers to make his living by his wits
rather than by hard labor. He starts with the idea of making
money easily, and does not care much finally about the honesty
of his proceedings.</p>

<p>In the market at York a learned man of New England origin
asked a farmer, “What is the price of your apples,—twenty-five
cents?” “Yes, you can have them for that; but I wouldn’t let
Kochersperger have them for a quarter,—he’s a Yankee.”</p>

<h3>THRIFT.</h3>

<p>In his speech in Congress upon the death of John Covode,
Simon Cameron declared that he honored Covode for his true
courage when he proclaimed in Philadelphia what weaker men
would have tried to suppress, giving as a reason for his hostility
to every species of human bondage the fact that his father had
been sold as a redemptionist near the spot where he was then
speaking. “Scarcely a generation had passed away,” adds Cameron,
“before the hired servants began to buy their masters’ lands,
to marry their masters’ daughters, and to make good their claim
to full equality with those whose bondsmen they had been. For
a time the Scotch-Irish made a sturdy stand for that supremacy
and superiority which seem to be their peculiar inheritance, place
them where you may. At length the thrift, the superior patience,
and the perseverance of the German blood prevailed. They
bought, and still possess, the old homesteads, and have furnished
us with an array of distinguished men of whom every citizen of
our State is justly proud.” The superior patience, says Mr. Cameron.
<i>Geduld ist das beste Kraut, das man in America baut</i>,—patience
is the best plant grown in America,—is a saying I have
heard in Lancaster County. But I must interrupt my regular
course to explain the word redemptionist used by Mr. Cameron.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
It was applied to persons coming here from Germany who were
unable to pay the expenses of their passage, and who were sold
or indentured for a term of years until that expense was paid.
Minor children were bound out until of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron also speaks of the Pennsylvania Germans dispossessing
the Scotch-Irish, and plenty of corroborative evidence of
this can be found. A learned gentleman has said to me that the
Scotch-Irish element, which used to be the leading one in Franklin
County, is in a great measure replaced by the Pennsylvania German.
“As the Irish farmers got poor and sold their land it was
bought by the Pennsylvania Germans, who then got rich by their
extreme thrift or severe economy and great industry.” A correspondent
of the Philadelphia <i>Press</i>, in 1871, goes further, and
writing from Brown’s Mills in the same county, from “the fertile
and picturesque Cumberland valley,” speaks of the Pennsylvania
Germans of that region as wearing the short gown and petticoat,
the shad-belly coat, and broad-brimmed hat. The district, he
says, was first settled by Scotch-Irish and Welsh, but these have
mostly been replaced; a few families of Lutherans and German
Reformed linger here, but their numbers annually grow less, and
the difficulty of supporting their ministers is yearly more serious.
Then, if we may trust this correspondent, it appears that the
<i>wehrlos</i>, or defenceless men (who do not pay ministers), are gaining
possession of that region. It was said of old time that the
meek shall inherit the earth. Far east of Franklin County, in
Montgomery, I was told of peacemen, the Schwenkfelders and
Mennonites, that they buy good farms. “They don’t buy the
hilly, stony ones; and, at the same time, I don’t know how it
comes they can afford to pay for them.”</p>

<p>The severe economy of the Pennsylvania Germans has been
just mentioned. One New-Year’s day I saw in a bank a young
man who was asked to subscribe for something. He declined, and
spoke of “our old Dutch rule that it is a bad plan to buy on
New-Year’s morning. Always get money in before you pay it
out.” In Northampton County an old resident is reported to have
said, “Do you know the difference between a Yankee farmer and
a Dutch one? When a Yankee farmer has apples, he sells the
scrubby ones and eats the good ones at home; and a Dutch
farmer picks out the scrubby ones to eat at home, and sells the
good ones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span></p>

<p>One of my Lancaster County neighbors has grain-bags that
have been in use on the farm for about seventy years, and bid fair
to last for twenty more. They were made from flax and hemp
grown on the farm. A young member of the family says that
their preservation not only shows the economy, but impresses him
with proofs of the good judgment of those who made them, in
selecting material, and in the thorough manner of their work. He
adds, “All these characteristics were, I think, possessed in full
measure by the people, somehow and somewhere misnamed
Dutch, in whose hands the largest part of Lancaster County has
become what it is.”</p>

<h3>CHARMS AND SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p>Mrs. G., born in Lebanon County, says that when they were
children one would take a looking-glass and go down the cellar-stairs
backward, in order to see therein the form of a future
spouse. Another custom was to melt lead and pour it into a cup
of cold water, expecting thence to discover some token of the
occupation of the same interesting individual. A person in York
also remembers that at Halloween her nurse would melt lead
and pour it through the handle of the kitchen door-key. The
figures were studied and supposed to resemble soldier-caps, books,
horses, and so on. This nurse was Irish, but the other domestics
were German. A laboring woman from Cumberland County,
and afterward from a “Dutch” settlement in Maryland, says that
she has heard of persons melting lead to see what trade their man
would be of. My German friend before quoted says that in the
Palatinate they melted the lead on New-Year’s eve. In Nadler’s
poems in the Palatinate dialect, St. Andreas’ night is the time
spoken of for melting the lead. This is the 30th of November.
Further, in a work called “The Festival Year” (<i>Das Festliche
Yahr</i>), by Von Reinsberg-Duringsfeld, Leipsic, 1863, the custom
of pouring lead through the beard, or wards, of a key is mentioned.</p>

<p>A lawyer, born in Franklin County, tells me that it is a common
superstition among Pennsylvania Germans that persons born on
Christmas night can see supernatural things and hear similar
sounds. He adds that his mother told him of a person who was
sceptical and ridiculed the idea, and was told to go out into his feeding-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
and listen. He lay down on the hay, and while there one
of the oxen said, “<i>Uebermorgen schieben mir unser Meschter auf den
Kirch-hof.</i>” (Day after to-morrow we will haul our master to the
graveyard.) And his funeral was on the day specified. My German
friend before quoted says that in the Palatinate they believe
that as it strikes twelve on Christmas eve, all animals talk together.
She adds, “I think that idea is through Germany.”</p>

<p>A gentleman connected with schools in Northampton County
says that at Halloween his daughters meet their companions and
melt lead into water to tell their fortunes. They also fill their
mouths with water that they may not speak, as speaking would
break the charm; and walk around a block of houses. The first
name which they hear is that of their future spouse. Another
practice, which, unlike the foregoing, may be tried at any time of
year, is to take a large door-key and tie it within the leaves of a
small Bible, the handle remaining out. Two girls rest the handle
upon their fingers, and repeat some cabalistic verse; of which, he
thinks, each line begins with a different letter, and the key will turn
at the initials of the future spouse. These, he says, are the remnants
of old superstitions, and he suspects that the human mind is
naturally superstitious. He adds, “The population of Easton is
mixed so that we cannot tell how many of these are purely German;
but by going into the rural German districts of Northampton
County you will find many strange ideas, such as that on a
certain church festival, say Ascension day, you must not sweep
your house, lest it become full of fleas.”</p>

<p>A simple-minded woman in Lancaster County, who showed
some regard for the Reformed Church, said that she had sat up late
sewing the night before, so as not to sew on Ascension day. “My
mother,” she said, “knew a girl that sewed on Ascension day;
and there came a gust and killed her.”</p>

<p>One of my German acquaintances calls my attention to the salt-cake
eaten in Lancaster. It is made extremely salt, and is eaten
by girls, who then go to bed backward without speaking and without
drinking; and he of whom they dream is to be their future
husband. This, he says, is a custom also in Germany.</p>

<p>But the most universal ideas of this superstitious kind are those
connected with the signs in the almanac. Baer’s Almanac, published
in Lancaster, still has the signs of the zodiac down the
pages, like one shown to me in the Palatinate, where a man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
some education said, “Here is where I see how to plant my
garden.” What, however, is very mysterious is that when our
people tell you you must not plant now, for <span class="allsmcap">IT</span> is in the Posy-woman
(and the things will all run to blossom, and not bear fruit),
they cannot tell <i>what</i> is in the Posy-woman, or Virgo. I infer,
however, that it is the moon.</p>

<p>I have been shown a German Bible, which belonged to the
grandfather of one of my neighbors, wherein the family births
were entered in the German language. I endeavored to decipher
one, as follows:</p>

<p>“<i>1797, September den 9ten 1st uns ein Sohn gebohren ihm Zeichen
Witter, ehr ist ihn dem nehmlichen Mohnat ihm Herren entshlafen.</i>”</p>

<p>“On the 9th of September, 1797, a son is born to us in the sign
of the Ram [Aries]. In the same month he fell asleep in the
Lord.”</p>

<p>The same neighbor who owns the old Bible just mentioned tells
me that one of the Russian Mennonites showed him a pamphlet in
the German language, which the man had brought from Europe;
wherein was told what would be the fortune of a child born in
each sign, his health, wealth, etc.; but my neighbor says that he,
himself, had no faith in it.</p>

<p>“Grain should be sowed in the up-going; meat butchered in the
down-going will shrink in the pot.” But my worthy neighbors
do not appear to know what it is that is going up and going down.
I infer, of course, that it is the moon. Is it not remarkable that
my neighbors should be so attached to book-farming? I knew a
woman, born among Friends, but in a Pennsylvania German settlement,
who was lamenting the smallness of the piece of meat on
the table. “What a little piece, and so big before it was cooked!
How it has shrunk! It is in the down-going. And those strawberries,
too, that I preserved, that went away to so little; they were
done in the down-going.” But one of her family spoke up,
bravely, “Just so, mother; that must be it. Now I know what’s
the matter with my portemonnaie, that it shrinks away so; it’s
the down-going.”</p>

<p>These beliefs in the influence of the heavenly bodies must be the
relics of astrology remaining in the almanacs, and never drawn
now from actual observation of the weather and the planets.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nevin relates the following (Philadelphia <i>Press</i>, June 2,
1875): “There are several superstitions connected with death and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
funerals in the country, which are a strange blending of the ludicrous
with the mournful. One is that if the mother of a family
is dying, the vinegar-barrel must be shaken at the time to prevent
the ‘mother’ in it from dying. Said a man once in sober earnest
to me, ‘I was so sorry Mr. D. was not in the room when his
wife died.’ ‘Where was he?’ ‘Oh, in the cellar a-shaking the
vinegar-barrel; but if he had just told me, I would have done it
and let him been in the room to see her take her last breath.’”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nevin adds: “Another superstition is that the last person
that goes out of a house at a funeral will be the next one to die,
and as the audience begins to thin, you may see people slip very
nimbly out of a back or kitchen door to avoid being that last one.”</p>

<p>The belief in <i>spooks</i> or ghosts is not lost in “Pennsylvania
Dutch” land. In some of his verses Mr. Schantz tells (Allentown
<i>Friedensbote</i>) of an abandoned school-house standing near a sand-pit,
beside some woods. He says,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“<i>kam mir zu Ohr</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Vom Sandloch Schuhlhaus am Kreuzweg</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Was Lesern ich nicht gern vorleg.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>S’ hen lent g’sad ‘Am Sandloch spukts!’</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>En mancher hot oft g’frogt, ‘Wie guckt’s?’</i></div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Laüfer nahme g’schwinde Schridde!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“About the sand-pit school-house, at the cross-roads, things were
said that I do not like to tell. It was told that there were spooks
at the sand-pit, and ‘In what shape?’ was asked. People riding
by rode rapidly, and those on foot hurried swiftly by.” There are
still standing near the Conestoga, close to Lancaster, the remains
of a building long and extensively known as “the spook house.”
It probably became unpopular from a suicide in it, or from having
been built in a field where strangers were buried.</p>

<p>A Lutheran clergyman said lately, “I do not believe in <i>spooks</i>
myself, but plenty of people do; and sad enough it is that there
should be such superstition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<h3>MEDICAL SUPERSTITIONS.</h3>

<p>The peculiarities of a people are always best observed by those
who do not live among them, or rather by those who visit them
occasionally. Most of my notes on this subject are taken from
the conversation of physicians born in other localities than those
in which they practise. One in my own county mentions the
“apnehme,” or wasting away of children. He says that popular
remedies are measuring the child and greasing it by certain old
women. Another says that the “Pennsylvania Dutch” also
measure for wild-fire or erysipelas, generally using a red silk
string, and measuring about sundown. They blow across the
affected part to blow the fire outside of the string, at the same
time they “say words” or powwow. This physician says that
the greasing above mentioned is for liver-grown children, and not
for “abnehme” (as it is spelled). One class of powwowers do not
interfere, he says, with regular practitioners; but one old woman
in this county (who builds a fire in the brick oven, and says words
over the coals) has been known to hide the prescriptions of regular
physicians. He adds: “If a person is burned, recourse is
sometimes had to a professional blower, who blows across the surface,
saying words in the interval. Along the Pennsylvania
Canal, on the Susquehanna, where ague prevails, the patient who
has a chill is tied to a tree by a long string, and he runs around
the tree until the string is exhausted, and then on to some distance.
This is tying the chill to a tree. A ‘Pennsylvania Dutch’ remedy
for whooping-cough, and one by which they bother the millers a
good deal, is to put the child into a hopper with grain, and let the
child remain until the grain is all ground out. Blood-stopping is
very common in Pennsylvania. I saw a man with an artery cut,
in whose case a blood-stopper was called in. The man pressed his
hand on the bleeding part and repeated something, raising his
eyes to heaven; but the artery was too powerful for him.”</p>

<p>On the west side of the Susquehanna the only county that can
distinctively be called Pennsylvania German is York. A physician
in the borough says that town and county are full of superstitions.
He says, “In case of hemorrhage from the nose, from a wound or
from other cause, a common cure is to wrap a red woollen string
round each finger; another is to lay an axe under the bed, edge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
upward; and you can’t talk them out of it. I used to get angry
when I first came here, but I found that it was of no use. These
are not occasional things only, but I have seen them over and over
again. Then there are prayers for stopping blood, always in
‘Dutch.’ They can’t be sick in English, and the first question to
me as a physician has been ‘<i>Kann er Deutsch?</i>’ (Do you speak
German?) One of the prayers for stopping blood is, I understand,
for human beings, and another for animals; and I think that the
names of the persons of the Trinity are introduced. I have often
asked, but they are not allowed to tell. Soon after I came here,
I ordered some boneset tea for a patient, and the mother asked in
‘Dutch’ whether the leaves should be pulled upwards or downwards.
‘Will it make any difference?’ I asked. ‘Oh, yes; if you
pull them upwards, it will work upwards; and if you pull them
downwards, it will work downwards.’ [A valuable hint for a
physician if the same plant can be used both as an emetic and a
purgative.] Of the blood of a black fowl,—no other color will
do,—three drops are given internally. I think this is for convulsions;
but I hear so many of these things, and have heard them
so many years, that they make no impression on my mind. These
are pure ‘Pennsylvania Dutch’ peculiarities; I have found none
or few of them among foreign Germans.”</p>

<p>I asked whether these ideas still continue or whether they are
wearing out. “No,” he said, “they don’t wear out. I meet them
every day. They still speak of horses and animals being bewitched
(<i>verhext</i>). I have a story from good authority of a horse
that was said to be <i>verhext</i>, and that turned out to have a nail in
his hoof. That is a fact. What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>But to come to another county, Berks. I hear that in Reading
there is a woman called the <i>Wurst-frau</i>, because her mother sold
sausages and “puddings.” This woman has a large office practice
in salves and powwowing. In an adjoining county, Lehigh, I
remember a few years ago to have seen the names of two persons
put down in the directory as <i>powwowers</i>; the word being spelled
as pronounced in “Dutch.”</p>

<p>Norristown, in Montgomery County, is greatly Anglicized; but
a physician says that an idea exists of stopping blood by a religious
lingo, into which come the words “<i>der Vater</i>, <i>Sohn</i>, <i>und
heilig Geist</i>.” “A certain man told me that he had never failed
to arrest bleeding from wounds or even from the lungs, nor was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
it necessary to be upon the spot; he could go home and repeat his
lingo. This was his only medical skill; he did not claim to be a
doctor.”</p>

<p>In Norristown also I met a woman who had been quite ill; but
I heard that when better she would not get up on Sunday, lest
she should never get well, and Friday was as bad. Her little
grandchild having a birth-mark, she passed the hand of a dead
person over it to take it away, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>To return, however, to this county of Lancaster, which I know
better. A physician says that he found a child very ill with membranous
croup, for which he left powders to be administered every
half-hour, saying that when he called again, if it seemed possible
to dislodge the membrane he would give an emetic. When he
called, he found a powwower sitting, who looked very smiling.
The doctor went up to the little patient, and asked whether the
mother had given the medicine. She had given only one dose;
the man had said that it was not necessary to give any powders.
“Don’t you think the child is better?” the mother asked. On
examination the doctor declared, “I am sorry to tell you that the
child will not live two hours;” which caused the countenance of
the powwower to fall. The child died, and this case caused the
doctor to declare that he would not practise in conjunction with
powwowers; and if they are now called in, it is done privately.</p>

<p>Although one physician spoke of not finding many of these
ideas among foreign Germans, yet my friend, before mentioned,
from the Palatinate says that when children have earache there,
or <i>abnehme</i> (wasting away), or when persons are in the early
stages of consumption, country people say, “<i>Lasz dir brauche</i>”
(or, Consult a powwower); and a woman comes and whispers
some words. “My father” (she adds that he was a Reformed
preacher) “knew a blacksmith to whom children were brought,
suffering with earache. The man would heat the big tongs, hold
them close to their ears, and whisper something. My father asked
him what he said. He answered, ‘Nothing; but if he did not
whisper, the people would not believe in him;’ and my father told
him that he ought not to impose upon them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<h3>HOLIDAYS—EASTER.</h3>

<p>I live in the country, but on last Good-Friday was at Reading,
and was surprised to see so many persons going to church. Easter
is greatly observed by Reformed and Lutherans. It is the time of
confirmation and administering the sacrament; and you may hear
of churches in country localities having as high as six hundred
communicants. At Easter, of course, eggs greatly abound. At
a boarding-house at Allentown I heard of colored eggs being offered
to callers or taken to friends. Fragments of egg and of colored
shells may be seen on the pavements for about a week.</p>

<p>A little childish myth is found in these more eastern counties, of
which I have heard very little in Lancaster County. It is that
the rabbit lays the colored eggs. A young man in Reading says
that when they were children they always made a nest the evening
before Easter Sunday, of an old hat or something similar,
which they set near the door for the rabbit to lay the colored eggs
in. An old man in a tavern, however, says that it is foolishness,
like <i>Bellschnickel</i>. At my own tavern the landlady was coloring
eggs, and had bought some canton-flannel rabbits with which to
dress the guests’ tables at breakfast on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>In Lehigh County a lawyer says that when they were children
they would take flax and each make his nest under a bush in
the garden. On Easter Sunday morning they would run out and
find three eggs of different colors in each nest. Literalness has
gone so far in Allentown that I hear of cakes in a baker’s window
in the form of a rabbit laying eggs.</p>

<p>At Easton a lady spoke of making nests for her two boys by
taking plates, ornamenting them with cut paper in the form of a
nest, putting into each a large candy egg and colored eggs, and
placing a rabbit in one and a chicken in the other, and hiding
them for the boys to find.</p>

<p>This myth of the rabbits’ eggs is very common among the Moravians.
One of my “Dutch” acquaintances, born west of us in
Cumberland County, and afterward living in Maryland, says that
her mother told them when children to set their bonnets at Easter
for nests for the rabbits’ eggs.</p>

<p>This is an old German myth. A gentleman from Switzerland
says that he heard the fable there, and he thinks that it prevails all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
over Germany. Many or most of our early German emigrants
into Pennsylvania seem to have come from or through the Palatinate.
My friend before mentioned, who was born there, thus describes
the custom at her former home. If the children have no
garden, they make nests in the wood-shed, barn, or house. They
gather colored flowers for the rabbit to eat, that it may lay colored
eggs. If there be a garden, the eggs are hidden singly in the
green grass, box-wood, or elsewhere. On Easter Sunday morning
they whistle for the rabbit, and the children imagine that they see
him jump the fence. After church, on Easter Sunday morning,
they hunt the eggs, and in the afternoon the boys go out in the
meadows and crack eggs or play with them like marbles. Or
sometimes children are invited to a neighbor’s to hunt eggs.</p>

<p>Prof. Wackernagel, of Allentown, has kindly pointed out to me
the antiquity of the myth. The old German goddess of spring
was called Ostara (whence Easter). She rode over the fields in
the spring in a wagon drawn by hares. (Our Pennsylvania rabbit
is really a hare, as it does not burrow in the ground.) The
egg is an emblem, says the professor, of the resurrection from the
dead; so herein he finds heathenism and Christianity blended.
However, the author of <i>Das Festliche Yahr</i> (Leipsic, 1863) considers
the myth older than Christianity; for he says that in Thuringia,
Hesse, Suabia, and Switzerland it is said now, as apparently
in ante-Christian times, that the hare or Easter hare lays the eggs.
Finally, one of my German friends finds the whole a myth of the
renewal of life in the spring.</p>

<h4>HALLOWEEN.</h4>

<p>On the 30th of last October our farmer locked the gate on the
road, lest it should be taken off. Therefore the Halloween visitors
limited themselves to taking down bundles of corn-fodder in the
field and building a fence across the road, and to propping up
one end of the market-wagon on the fence. I am told of a person
who once had his wagon taken apart, and the pieces put up into
different trees, so that it was some time before all were found. In
Lebanon County a similar custom is found. One of my acquaintances
living in a small town says that they celebrate Halloween
roughly,—hanging beets and cabbages at the doors, moving steps,
taking gates from hinges, throwing corn. The speaker was born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
in Lehigh County, where nothing of this prevailed, and this fact
constitutes one of the chief distinctions among our Pennsylvania
Germans of Lancaster and Lebanon on one hand, and Lehigh,
Berks, upper Montgomery, and probably Northampton on the
other. In Montgomery a young “Dutchman” did not even know
when Halloween is, and when I described our Lancaster County
custom, said, “That ain’t any use.” Traces of similar observances
of Halloween are found, however, in other regions. In
Philadelphia the boys indulge in ringing front-door bells. In
Harrisburg people who had wooden door-steps used to take them
into the house, lest they should be carried off. Of Franklin
County, beyond the Susquehanna, I am told that at Waynesboro’
it has been a favorite amusement at Halloween to gather store-boxes
and build a fortification around the town pump, and collect
wheeled vehicles around the public square. At Lockhaven, up
the West Branch of the Susquehanna, my landlady was anxious
that her cabbage should be housed, for fear that it would be carried
off on Halloween.</p>

<p>My German acquaintances, before quoted, born in the Palatinate,
do not report to me anything of this kind as existing in Germany
at Halloween. One of them says, however, that at the time of
putting up string-beans (which are preserved like sour-krout),
children throw the strings into front doors. And Mr. Wollenweber,
of Reading, also a native of the Palatinate, says that when
the farm-work was over in October, they used to practise tricks.
He has helped to take a wagon to pieces, and put it together again
in a stable or barn. “We troubled ourselves very much,” he
says. He adds that the boys were expected, when the fun was
over, to come together and take it down again; but this is not the
case in Lancaster County.</p>

<p>Can it be that some of these practices belong to the season of
the year, and are a warning to the tardy to gather the fruits of the
earth and their farm implements?</p>

<p>In his work called <i>Die Alte Zeite</i>, or Old Times, Mr. H. L.
Fisher, of York, Pennsylvania, describes such pranks as played
at weddings or home-comings “infares.” The boys hid the bridegroom’s
horse in a quarry, and the young men’s saddles and bridles
were put upon trees, straw-stacks, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p>In the text I have spoken of Bellschnickel, who in “Pennsylvania
Dutch” land takes the part of Santa Claus, being in fact
the same personage; Bellschnickel, or Peltz Nickel, being St.
Nicholas in furs. St. Nicholas day is not, however, Christmas
eve. It is the 6th of December; but it is in Advent. One of
my German friends thus describes Peltz Nickel: “In the Palatinate
at Christmas they have the Christ-kindchen, which is a
little girl dressed in white and riding on a donkey. I often made
one myself, dressed in my mother’s wedding-veil. If you have
no donkey, a boy is dressed to represent one and goes on all-fours.
The Peltz Nickel is a boy leading; he is blackened, and has a
beard and rattling chains. He gives a switch to the mother,
which sticks behind the glass the whole year, if the children do
not hide nor break it. This begins on the first Sunday of December,
with Advent, and may be practised till Christmas. He carries
apples and nuts. The children must kneel and say their
prayers, and if they say them nicely they get some of these, and
perhaps honey-cakes and candy, which the Christ-kindel and
Peltz Nickel distribute; but they do not give the Christmas
gifts.” She adds, “We only went to one or two houses.”</p>

<p>As regards the New Year, Mr. Wollenweber says that in
Berks County, around Womelsdorf, a dozen boys or so will form
a company, choose a captain, take a gun, and go around the
neighborhood, calling on different persons and asking leave to
wish them a New Year. If they obtain consent, they will form
into a rank, and the captain will repeat the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nau wunschen wir euch en Neues Yohr,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">En Bretzel wie en Scheuer Thor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">En Brodwurst wie en Ofen Rohr,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Und in der Midde-Stub en Tisch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oof yedem Eck en gebrodener Fisch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Und in der Mitt en Bottell Wein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Das soll unser Neu Yohr’s Wunsch sein.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Now we wish you a New Year; a pretzel like a barn-door; a
fried sausage like a stove-pipe; and in the middle room a table,
with a fried fish at each corner, and in the midst a bottle of wine,—that
shall be our New Year’s wish.”</p>

<p>Then they fire off the gun, and are invited to come in and take a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
supper. Generally they go to farm-houses, where there are a
number of daughters, and these daughters are usually prepared
to give them a hospitable reception.</p>

<p>This custom, says Mr. Wollenweber, also prevails in the Palatinate.</p>

<p>I am also told that the custom of firing-in the New Year is
found in Lehigh, Berks, and Lebanon Counties.</p>

<h3>THE PLAINER SECTS.</h3>

<p>Some of our Pennsylvania German Baptist sects cannot escape
a suspicion of asceticism. I speak of them as Baptists, for not
only the Dunkers who dip, but the Mennonites who pour, are
Baptists, because they baptize on faith, adults or young persons,
and not infants. At the time of the great Centennial Exposition
one of our farmers told me that although their members were not
forbidden to visit it, yet it had been recommended for them not
to do so. He said that there were worldly things there, unnecessary
things. Of the stricter sect of New Mennonites I heard that
they were forbidden. But as these churches are of simple congregational
form, this rule and this recommendation may have
been local.</p>

<p>I met another farmer on a railway train, and asked about the
Exposition. He answered, “I don’t think the Lord has any love
to them things. It’s like those picnics and things; those that will
go to them will do anything.” But his name was afterward connected
with a more disreputable thing than a picnic.</p>

<p>In some things our New Mennonites are very strict. It is said
that one was obliged to take down his front porch and another to
cut down his evergreen-trees, apparently because they were suspected
of being “proud.” A woman inclined to the same sect
cultivated no flowers. Yet it is surprising how showily the members
allow their unbaptized children to dress, in which they are a
great contrast to the Amish. It is the same New Mennonites who
have so rigid a ban in the church of which I have spoken in the
text. I have spoken of a father who did not come to the family
table. A member of the church was kind enough to explain to
me the cause. He gave way to a selfish spirit, found fault unnecessarily.
The wife bore it a long time, and then complained to
the meeting, whereupon he did not show a penitent spirit; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
was not willing to humble himself before her. So they continued
to eat apart, to be separate. Our Old Mennonites confess their
faults to each other in an open meeting of the members. If the
same rule prevails among the New Mennonites, we can see that it
would not be at all grateful to the pride of “the natural man” to
apologize thus to a meeting of which the wife was a part.</p>

<p>As regards another sect, the River Brethren, an acquaintance
tells me that he was expelled from them for voting at elections;
but still some of the brethren will vote. But against him there
were two other charges, namely, of having a melodeon in his
house and having his property insured.</p>

<p>Another division of the Mennonites are the Amish, who are
very simple in dress and habits, very recluse. I once called on a
plain old Amish farmer in moderate circumstances. His clothing
was long worn, but clean and well mended, and his bent form,
silver beard and hair commanded regard. A neighbor was with
him whom he called Chrissly, the nickname of Christian. In
conversation I spoke of one of my relatives as a lawyer, and I
saw that this had an immediate effect. The neighbor remarked
that when Judge Jasper Yeates was growing old, he said that
lawyers are like woollen yarn, they will stretch. The old man
added, “I guess they must tell rather more than the truth when
they <i>blead</i>.”</p>

<p>I said to the old man, “You all vote?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there’s some of them a little conscientious; but if they
are, they can just leave it alone. It may be I’m dumb; but I just
think we must have government,—we have Scripture for it,—and
if the good people—what I call the tame people—stays away and
leaves it all to the rowdies, how would it be? We must <i>bray</i> for
the government; do all we can. We mustn’t go to pole-raisings.
It oughtn’t to be, but sometimes they will, you know.”</p>

<p>“Do any of your young men learn trades?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; some are carpenters or cabinet-makers.”</p>

<p>“But you would rather have them farmers; why do you like
that best?”</p>

<p>“I think if a man’s a <i>Gristian</i>, that’s the best thing he can
undertake.”</p>

<p class="tb">I have been told of an Amish farmer who was sitting at table
with several young men who had lately joined the meeting, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
been baptized. One of these was his hired man called Yoney (a
nickname for Jonathan). The Amish here do not in general wear
suspenders, and the old man, addressing Yoney, said, “<i>Was hasht
du verschproke in der Gemeh?</i>” (What did you promise in meeting?)
The young man looked at his clothes, and the elder pointed
out the suspenders.</p>

<p>Yoney answered that he was allowed to wear the clothes that he
already had until they were worn out.</p>

<p>“These look like new ones.”</p>

<p>“They were my best ones,” he answered, “and I have just
begun to wear them every day.”</p>

<p>A girl who has lived among the Amish has told me that they
are obliged to give to beggars or “stragglers,” or they would be
turned out of meeting. She does not know indeed that they are
obliged to give to those who are able to work; but she did not
believe that she ever saw them turn any away.</p>

<p>The impression prevails concerning the Amish that they endeavor
to fulfil the saying, “Give to him that asketh of thee, and
from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.” When
I turn my mind to these plain people, I sometimes recall the trailing
arbutus, which is found partly buried under the leaves and
clinging close to the surface of the ground, but which when drawn
up displays, though sometimes disfigured with dead, brown leaves,
such a delicate form and tint, and exhales so sweet a perfume.</p>

<p>And I also have recalled Pope’s <i>Temple of Fame</i>:</p>

<p>Yet our Amish are not a highly-educated people. Some years
ago I inquired of a neighbor (who did not speak English fluently)
on the subject of education. He said that they were not opposed
to school-learning, but to high learning. “To send children to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
school from ten to twenty-one, we would think was opposed to
Holy Scripture. There are things taught in school that don’t
agree with Holy Scripture.”</p>

<p>I asked whether he thought it was wrong to teach that the earth
goes round the sun. “I don’t know anything about it; but I am
not in favor of teaching geography and grammar in the schools:
it’s worldly wisdom.”</p>

<p class="tb">All these Baptist sects have an unpaid ministry. Dr. H., of
Bucks County, had a patient who was a Mennonite preacher, and
the doctor refused to receive payment, saying that his father had
taught him never to take pay from ministers of the gospel. The
preacher looked sober and worried, but left quietly, and not long
after he came bringing oats and corn for the doctor’s horse. Afterwards
he would bring flour or buckwheat-meal and choice bits
about butchering time. Thus he seems, without entering into
argument, to have relieved conscientious scruples about taking
pay for preaching.</p>

<p class="tb">The ceremonial of these plain German sects is not formal and
stately, like that of the Romish Church. A Moravian of Bethlehem
was amused with one of their ministers, who, in ordaining
a preacher, said, “<i>Nau kannscht du taufe, und nau kannscht du
copulire</i>.” (Now you can baptize, and now you can marry.)
Then turning to a brother, “<i>Hab ich net ebbes vergesse? Oh, ya;
nau kannscht du auch beim Abendmahl diene</i>.” (Haven’t I forgotten
something? Oh, yes; now too you can serve in the
Supper.)</p>

<p>Perhaps I would better translate the foregoing, “Thou can
serve in the Supper,” for our Pennsylvania Germans generally
use the pronouns thee and thou.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Mennonites have not a great yearly meeting like that of
the Dunkers. In 1874 a correspondent of one of our Lancaster
papers spoke of a national meeting held in Illinois by the Dunkers.
He said, “They had abundant provision for the comfort of the
brethren. The tent held ten thousand people. Eighty beeves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
were on the ground for steaks and roasts, and one baker had orders
for eleven thousand loaves of bread.” This year I see a statement
that the national Conference was held in Indiana, and that twenty
thousand people were on the ground. Dr. Seidensticker (<i>Century
Magazine</i>, December, 1881) states the number of the Dunkers in
the United States at about two hundred thousand, with nearly
two thousand ministers, none of whom receives a salary. They
pay more attention to education than the Mennonites, having now
three collegiate institutes.</p>

<p class="tb">Mennonites are still found in Europe; in Holland, Prussia, Switzerland,
the Palatinate, etc. They are sometimes distinguished in
Germany into Heftler and Knöpfler, or Hook men and Button
men; whence it seems that one of the distinctions here is widespread
and of former origin. In 1881 I visited a family in the
Palatinate, where I was shown a black satin waistcoat which the
father had once worn, with hooks and eyes down the front; but
none of our Amish here would wear anything so showy as a black
satin waistcoat.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1881, a Mennonite preacher in the Palatinate
gave me a list of many of the European communities, with names
of their officers, such as preachers, deacons, etc. Many of the
same names are found in Lancaster County, though not generally
spelled in the same way. Such are Frantz, Lichti, Landes, Lehmann,
Bachmann, Oesch, Bähr and Bär, Zercher, Krehbiel, Neff,
Binkele, Muselmann, Brubacher, Staehly, Wickert. The family
of Stauffer, in my own immediate neighborhood, has possessed for
several generations the given names John and Christian. On
the European list I find two Christian Stauffers, and one marked
Johann Stauffer II.</p>

<p>I met in the Palatinate one who had travelled in Switzerland,
and who had seen Mennonites there. All that he met there were
farmers, who sold milk when near towns, or made butter and
cheese when at a distance. They were mostly Amish. One Amish
family, who still wore hooks and eyes, were named Stauffer.
Other families whom he knew or heard of were named Wenger,
Schwartz, Rettiger, etc.</p>

<p>I find in the volume just mentioned a little description of a Mennonite
congregation near Tilsit, in Prussia, which shows how
closely agricultural the people are. There are altogether about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
eight hundred (five hundred and twenty being baptized). Seven
hundred and seventy live in the country, in town thirty. Fifteen
belong to the mercantile class, to mechanics twenty-four, to laborers
seventy. The rest own or rent land (<i>sind Grundbesitzer und
Rentier</i>).</p>

<p>From this volume, some of the Russian Mennonites appear to
have adopted river-baptism. One body of Russians went to
Taschkant in Middle Asia, and seem to have been quite unfortunate,
as most of us would expect non-resistants to be among those
nearly barbarians. And these emigrants were extremists, refusing
obedience to worldly authorities; they were unwilling to plant
forests in lieu of military service in Russia; the office of preacher
they considered a human institution, and called themselves the
spouse of the Lord. (<i>Brautgemeinde des Herrn.</i>)</p>

<p class="tb">I have received a copy of the Family Almanac for 1882, published
by a Mennonite company in Indiana, which bears on the
cover a little engraving of the sword being beaten into the ploughshare,
and the motto above, “Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men.”</p>

<p>Within the almanac, among other matter, is the well-known
engraving of a man surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac,
and headed thus, “Anatomy of Man’s Body as said to be governed
by the Twelve Constellations.” I find the words <i>said to be</i> significant,—perhaps
the introduction of some scrupulous person. On
the same page is the statement, “Jupiter is the ruling planet this
year.”</p>

<p>A meeting calendar at the close of the almanac gives forty-two
meeting-houses in Lancaster County, and twenty-two others in
this State. Also eleven in Indiana, one in Michigan, and seventeen
in Virginia. There are many Mennonites in Ohio, but this
list does not speak of them. Those meeting-houses mentioned
make nearly one hundred; but probably the list contains none of
the New or Reformed Mennonites, also none of the Amish, who
almost invariably meet in private houses. A peculiarity of the
Mennonite meetings in the list just spoken of is the long interval
between meetings, which is mostly two or four weeks, and in three
cases eight weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p class="tb">In the article in the text called Schwenkfelders a careful observer
will note a discrepancy. The author speaks of their holding
the Spirit above the Scriptures; but also quotes Schwenkfeld as
speaking in substance of “the gifts of grace revealed by the
Father; yet so that this revelation should unite with the witness
of the Scriptures.” The author has not read Schwenkfeld’s works,
but quotes from different sources.</p>

<p>Before closing these remarks on the plainer sects, I may add that
they are all evangelical, at least there are no Socinian “Menists”
here as in Holland in the time of William Penn. The Dunkers do
not believe in eternal perdition.</p>

<p>Further as regards one of these plainer sects, I may ask, Are
they degenerating physically? This must be the tendency, it would
seem, in all small religious bodies, limited in marriage to their own
membership; but this may be compensated for by simplicity and
purity of life and freedom from agitation and pecuniary distress.</p>

<h3>THE PEOPLE CONTRASTED.</h3>

<p>It will be seen that there are among the Pennsylvania Germans
two classes who may be compared or contrasted. The one party
may be called the people of Lancaster and Lebanon, the Baptist
and peace; the other, the people of Berks, Lehigh, and Northampton,
the Reformed and Lutheran party. There are, however,
many Reformed and Lutherans in the former division, but extremely
few of the peace people in the latter. In Bucks and
Montgomery on the east, Cumberland and other counties on the
west, the different classes are mingled with many “English.” I
have already pointed out that many of the peace people are of
Swiss origin; of the other division, many or most appear to have
been Palatines, and perhaps French refugees. I have already
pointed out also how these two parties differ, the most astonishing
difference being that of politics. During the civil war the one
party opposed the government, which the other sustained. I find a
surprising instance in my notes: A worthy Schwenkfelder told me
of places in the northern part of Montgomery where party spirit
seemed to have run riot, where vendue-criers would use such language
as this: one held up an old scythe, and, as if to enhance its
merits, said that it would do to cut old Lincoln’s head off. The
great contrast, however, in politics between the two districts alluded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
to may of course have had some other origin than the sectarian
differences of the people. It must be remembered, however,
in Germany, that for a long period the Reformed and
Lutheran were state churches; and these other bodies that existed
there were dissenters.</p>

<p>In language I have pointed out small differences. In holidays I
have shown how Lancaster and Lebanon keep Halloween, in a
manner unknown to the eastern counties. In the three “Dutch”
counties of the east we have the rabbit myth more extensive than
here in Lancaster. While those three have great agricultural
county fairs, Lancaster has held none since before the war. I attribute
this in a great measure to the opposition of our Baptist
farmers to horse-racing and its concomitants.</p>

<p>A friend gives me another small point of difference. In Lancaster,
at Christmas-time, is sold a cake called <i>Motzebom</i>, which is
not seen in Eastern Pennsylvania. This, he adds, is from the
Italian <i>marzepane</i>, or bread of St. Mark, which came from Italy
into Germany; in England called marchpain.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<p>Said a young man to us, “My daddy won’t sit in no rocking-chair.
He has a crutch agin’ a rocking-chair.” It appears that
the same objection has been felt by other Pennsylvania Germans.
Wollenweber gives us a farmer talking to his children in the
spring, who says especially that none of the girls is to sit in a
rocking-chair on a working-day. In sounding the praises of
Womelsdorf, Berks County, the same author tells us that the
women are never seen sitting in a rocking-chair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may sometimes judge of a person’s character by hearing the
arguments used to induce him to act. Thus does Wollenweber
endeavor to induce the people of Womelsdorf to erect a monument
to Conrad Weiser, who is buried near the town, and who
was a distinguished German pioneer. Wollenweber encourages
them to raise a subscription. Certainly, he says, the man who
owns the place would not object to having a beautiful monument
on his farm; and thousands would go to see it; so that the railroad
company, the turnpike company, and all the tavern-keepers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
in the neighborhood would make a good thing of it. “Alas!” he
adds, “most of the people who live round there do not know how
to prize the treasure they possess.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These are rural similes used by Wollenweber, whose little volume
is “in the idiom and manner of speech of the Pennsylvania Germans.”
It tells of girls who want to be English (who profess to
talk English), but when some one from town talks to them, they
stand like a hen who has dropped an egg. Again, we read that
Weiser remonstrated with Stiegel on account of his extravagance,
etc.; but he might as well have talked to a dead calf.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the best article in the collection (which is indeed of very
unequal merit) is the story of the dreadful noise that was heard just
before daylight in Lancaster County, near Berks. The people went
to Squire Reinhold’s to talk about it, and the squire, who was very
high learned, thought it must be the train of the wild huntsman,
presaging war, pestilence, and scarcity. He had a German book
that told about it. One stout young fellow, however, had a mind
to see for himself; and he took with him an old shoemaker, who
had fought in the Buckshot war, and who was fearfully full of
courage when he had emptied a pint of whiskey, but whom anybody
could chase away when he was sober. (The Buckshot war was
a bloodless affair at Harrisburg, in 1838.)</p>

<p>This pair went to watch, and heard nothing for two or three
nights, but at last about three in the morning a noise was heard as
if every storm-wind had broken loose. The shoemaker was so
frightened that he sank down at the foot of a tree and buried his
head in the fallen leaves. But the young man discovered that the
noise was caused by an immense flock of wild pigeons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It has been hinted in the text that the Pennsylvania Germans
are not refined. One of their preachers has told me of their being
a gross, unrefined people, and of his being often obliged to see
things that he would rather not. Another preacher gave me this
anecdote: A man, speaking of his son, said, “I would rather have
lost my best horse as Jake. He was such a fellow to work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of those who are yoked together in life and do not pull together,
the “Dutch” of Berks and Lehigh say, “<i>Der ehne keht chee un
der onnere keht haw</i>.” (One gees and the other haws.) It is
applied also to others who do not agree, and is heard also thus,
“<i>Ehnce will chee, oonce anner will ho</i>.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although our “Pennsylvania Dutch” are of undoubted German
origin, yet in common speech they almost always speak of themselves
as Dutch, which sounds much more like <i>Deutsch</i> than German
does; and it is not a great length of time since Germans were
so called. I think that it was in Miss Aiken’s life of Elizabeth
that I found the following. One of the suitors to the queen was
brother to the emperor of Austria. The Earl of Sussex wrote to
Elizabeth, “His highness, besides his natural language of Dutch,
speaketh very well Spanish and Italian.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following are from newspapers of different dates:</p>

<p>In 1869 a literary society in Lancaster County discussed the
question, Resolved, that wealth exerts a greater influence than
knowledge. The decision was in favor of the affirmative.</p>

<p>In 1872 a lyceum in the same county debated the subject that
wealth has a greater influence on the people in general than
education. The decision was in favor of education, “contrary to
expectation.”</p>

<p>In 1879, in another literary society in our county, this referred
question was answered, Is laziness a habit, a disease, or a sin?
If we only had the answer!</p>

<p>At a lyceum in Berks County in 1882 was discussed this subject,
Resolved, that ambition is a greater evil than intemperance. The
judges decided in favor of the affirmative; the house afterwards in
the negative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following seems to be from a report in the Reading <i>Eagle</i>:
Samuel J. and his wife returned from their wedding trip on Monday
evening, when they were serenaded early by a band, and later
Butcher arrived before the bride’s house with the si-gike, followed
by about one hundred little boys. After making the welkin ring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
for about one hour, Samuel handed over a V, and the band left
in high glee.</p>

<p>At my own home I have heard the sound of these rough serenades,
borne over the fields in notes by distance made less harsh.
The instruments are pots and pans beaten, and a horse-fiddle,
made by putting rosin on edges of a box, and drawing a rail over
them. In my own neighborhood I hear that this rough play is
going out of fashion as musical bands are coming in.</p>

<p>In the south of England I saw an aged pair who had received
a rough serenade on account of conjugal disturbances.</p>

<p>A friend, born in the Palatinate, tells me that rough serenades
were formerly practised there, and called <i>Katzen</i>-musik (cat
music), or charivari. They were introduced on the occasion of
disproportionate marriages. Thus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Eine alte Frau und ein junger Mann</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Die müsse Charivari han.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“An old wife and a young husband must have a serenade.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Berks County a young publisher told me that when visiting
the country and asking his subscribers how they liked his paper,
he received answer that it was “a very nice paper for the cupboard.”
Being a large-sized paper, it was a good one to spread
upon shelves to keep them clean.</p>

<p>Lancaster County men connected with the press have had similar
experiences. One canvassing for a paper to be published in a
small town came across an old man and his wife tying covers on
pots of apple-butter, and showed them a specimen copy. He was
answered, “<i>Ich verlang’s net. Es macht net vier Happe-deckel</i>.”
(I don’t want it. It won’t make four pot-covers.)</p>

<p>When the <i>Lancaster County Farmer</i> was started it was in small
pamphlet form. A person in the office showed it to a man, who
took hold of it, opened it, and looked at the other side, but believed
he would not take it: it was almost too small to tie apple-butter
crocks with.</p>

<p>A man came into the office of the Lancaster <i>Express</i>, Republican,
and wished to “pay his paper.” I will call his post-office
Blackburn. Considerable time was spent in looking over the list
of the weekly paper and trying to find his name, and then he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
asked whether it was not the daily. No, he did not think it was.
And was he sure that he got it from Blackburn Post-Office
“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s the <i>Intelligencer</i>.”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe it is; it’s a Democrat paper.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have spoken of old apple-butter. The following is condensed
from a Lancaster paper of 1874: “A gentleman handed us a few
days since a bottle of apple-butter made in 1820, being fifty-three
years old last fall. It is still good, and retains its original flavor.
It was part of the ‘housestire’ of Mrs. R. of this county after her
marriage.” (<i>Haus steur</i> is the house-furnishing. Apple-butter
kept so long dries away to a very small bulk, but can be renewed
by boiling it with water.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a Quaker settlement in Lancaster County, nearly extinct
among the “Dutch,” a father urged his son to activity thus:
“Let me see if thee’ll go on and help me like a little Dutch boy
would do, or whether thee’ll linger and loiter about.” When the
boy had got into college he told of his neighbors’ saying, “Too
much eddication, you know, makes a man lazy.” A neighboring
farmer was inquiring for a person to help him in haying and
harvest, and the lad spoke for himself, saying that some people
thought he was lazy, but that he could work and was willing to
work. “Still, you’re a little lazy,” answered the farmer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Riding one evening we met an Amish farmer on horseback
driving a very clean sow. We stopped, and I asked whether he
had a certain book which contains a notice of the Amish. He
answered that he did not have many books.</p>

<p>“My Bible and Testament’s enough for me to read;” then,
recollecting himself, “and the Martyr-Book, I have that.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Does Mr. Kennel live here?” inquired a stranger of an Amish
farmer.</p>

<p>“Joe Kennel lives here. I’m the man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. R. has told me that in 1853, at the age of six, he went to
public school in this county. He had just learned to read, and
was put into a class in the Testament. They read four to six times
a day. It took them about three months to accomplish the Testament,
and then the teacher put them into the Bible, which they
completed, Mr. R. says, before he was eight years old, but under
a succeeding teacher.</p>

<p>“We hadn’t many books in those days,” says Mr. R.; “I used
to read the weekly <i>Tribune</i> down to the names of the Kansas
settlers.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The custom of barring out the teacher at Christmas appears not
yet to be extinct in Lancaster County.</p>

<p>The scholars demand a Christmas gift, but are not always successful.
One teacher near here walked calmly home, and allowed
the scholars to open the door at their leisure.</p>

<p>An acquaintance, born in Northampton County, tells me that
at his native place the teacher was locked out not at Christmas, but
on Shrove-Tuesday, and merely for sport.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That peculiarity of some Germans by which they pronounce
Goble like Kopel is also found in Pennsylvania. A certain carpenter
could not tell me whether his son’s name was Beck or
Peck. And an “English” boy supposed that a certain man had
a hare-lip, as he heard him spoken of as Cutlip, but his name was
Gottlieb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A neighboring farmer came to our house with his little boy,
about five years old. I handed the little fellow a penny, and he
began to pull his father, who was talking.</p>

<p>“He gives it to you, does he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, to put into his box. He’s got two full. I’ll have to steal
them some day, I guess,” winking at me.</p>

<p>“That’s the way you teach them to save?” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes, keep them till he gets big. Buy a horse and buggy with
them, he says.”</p>

<p>Then, with paternal pleasure, “He tells his mother he don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
want no hilly land.” Strange for a family of Swiss descent?
Their ancestors had enough hills in Switzerland. How they enjoy
this level limestone land!</p>

<p>One of my acquaintances thinks that the reason these people
or this class got the rich limestone land was that they were not
afraid of the labor of cutting down the heavy timber which grew
on it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have just told how the little fellow was saving his pennies to
“buy a horse and buggy,”—the great pride of our farmer boy’s
heart. On a neighboring farm to ours lived the grandfather, who
had his own plain carriage, the father with another, and two
sons, aged about twenty-one, each with a buggy. This must be
the great extravagance of our young farmers now. But having
buggies they can take the girls to ride; and they can sometimes
take others too. The other day a lad kindly took me up; an
Amish boy, in a plain buggy, driving a pretty good horse. As
our Amish so often drive in wagons, covered with light-colored
oil-cloth, I made some remark about the buggy, and the lad
answered that it was his. He is fourteen years old.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have heard of a Miss K., who was considered
a great catch, being thought rich by the young “Dutch
fellows.” Among the numerous young men who came to see her
was one who drove two horses. Her father asked him what business
he was in.</p>

<p>“Not in any just now.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how you can keep two horses;” which remark
was fully understood as putting an end to the young man’s suit.
He needn’t come there no more!</p>

<p>The mania for a driving-team accounts for the occasional disappearance
of harness when left unguarded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A lawyer in Lancaster describes a peculiarity of our people.
In most places, he says, a man comes in, tells you what he wants,
and perhaps retains you in his case. But here there is first a conversation
on diverse subjects.</p>

<p>Another says that the country people expect you to hear an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
account of their ailings and those of their friends and the state of
the crops before proceeding further.</p>

<p>A neighbor coming to our house to get a horse and vehicle,
talked perhaps half an hour, as if on a friendly call, before she
told her errand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is hard for some of our Pennsylvania Germans to write a letter
in English. I wrote once to a preacher, who got the ticket-agent
at the railroad to answer. The following was sent by a
workingman:</p>

<p>“Dear A B Your man have pacts that Roof has left some stuff
mite I have them to pact my slate roof the leeke I sought the
might spile so I mite youse it as well as let the leek away ensur
soon. <span class="spacer">Yours</span> <span class="spacer">C D</span>.”</p>

<p>Which may be interpreted thus: “Your man has patched that
roof, and has left some stuff. Might I have it to patch my slate-roof,—the
leak? I thought it might spoil, so I might use it as
well as let it leak away. Answer soon.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young “English” girl was visiting a “Dutch” one, and
the father of the latter, a substantial farmer, was kindly going to
take the visitor part way home. The girls stayed talking above
until the voice of the farmer was heard at the foot of the stairs,
“Staytsch!” He was no more to be trifled with than the stage-driver.</p>

<p>Once when absent from home he bought a plaster cast of Canova’s
Three Graces. Such things are not seen in “Dutch” farm-houses,
and ere long the Three Graces were provided with petticoats
of pink and blue tissue-paper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An expression that is very offensive to our Pennsylvania Germans,
when applied to them by “English” folks, is “dumb
Dutch.” Dumb is of course the German <i>dumm</i>, stupid, and it is
familiarly used by our Pennsylvania Germans themselves. One
of my friends said that she thought she could learn to use a
sewing-machine,—“People as dumb as me has learned to use
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span></p>

<p>A Lancaster gentleman gave me this little anecdote:</p>

<p>Old Mrs. H., anxious to see a baptism by immersion, proposed
to her hired girl, Susan, to go across the fields to the place where
there was to be baptism in the creek. Waymaking they were to
cross the same creek by a log, but Mrs. H. fell in to her waist.
Wading back to the bank, Susan standing alarmed, Mrs. H. said,
quietly and quickly, “<i>Suss, mir hens yetst g’seh; yetst welle mir
hame geh</i>;” or, “Susy, we’ve seen it now; now let’s go home.”</p>

<p>A lawyer, Mr. W., who taught in Schuylkill County about
fifteen or twenty years ago, has given me some of his recollections.</p>

<p>He said that among the mines in Schuylkill the population is
English, that is, American, Welsh, Scotch, and Irish, but in the
valleys there are “Dutch” farmers, mostly Lutherans, he thinks.</p>

<p>“The farmers lived well in the valleys of Schuylkill County;
no danger of freezing in winter between two feather-beds;” and
Mr. W. liked the fried <i>pawn-haus</i>, although he found it rather
rich.</p>

<p>“In that county I had some of the pleasantest times. I was
there as a teacher, and they immediately appropriated me. I was
not obliged to wait for the formality of an introduction in the
German community. I could see, however, a tendency to mistrust
the man of Yankee origin, and to combine against him; the young
men fearing lest the teacher should cut them out with the girls.
I was invited to go one evening on a sleighing-party. There were
an equal number of young men and girls, and at a village we took
in two fiddlers. We drove several miles to a stone tavern or farm-house
(for the tavern-keeper is generally a farmer). The fiddlers
sat in the window-seats, formed by the thick stone walls; and the
dance was lively until the small hours. The dancers made a business
of it, and went to work with a will. The dances were called
‘straight eights,’ forward and back, and mostly shuffles. Although
at a tavern, none got drunk. Coming home, the driver increased
the fun by upsetting the party in the snow.</p>

<p>“I taught public school, and on account of not speaking German
I had much difficulty with the younger scholars, who, being
under the care of their mothers, seldom heard the English language.
The home talk was always in ‘Dutch,’ as they called it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
though the fathers, when transacting business, were able to speak
English.</p>

<p>“Even the larger pupils were not able to understand all of their
lessons in English. Some of the farmers were rich. The ‘Dutch’
farmers were universally Democrats.” So says Mr. W.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another lawyer, named H. (of Pennsylvania German origin),
has given me some of his recollections of Berks County. Berks
is that county concerning which it has been a standing joke
that its people still voted for Andrew Jackson,—a well-worn
joke.</p>

<p>“It must have been a select party,” says Mr. H., “that W. was
at, if none of them got drunk.”</p>

<p>“The great dancing tunes in Berks are Fisher’s Hornpipe,
Washington’s Grand March, Charlie over the Water, Yankee
Doodle, Hail Columbia, and We won’t go Home till Morning.”</p>

<p>“The walls in the stone houses in Berks are generally two feet
thick, built like forts, with plenty of room to sit in the window-seats,
but usually the landlord had a long bar-room table, on which
he put chairs for the fiddlers. About every third dance they must
have a drink, which frequent potations sometimes brought them
to the floor, unable to distinguish sounds.” “The dancing they
indulge in in Berks,” says Mr. H., “is not the fashionable kind,
but is more exhausting than mauling rails in August, or thrashing
rye with a flail. The figures are called out by some skilful person;
the dances are called straight fours or hoe-downs, the dancers
being arranged in four rows, in a sort of double column on each
side. After the inside couples have danced and all have changed
places, the former are allowed to rest while the outside couples
dance.”</p>

<p>“The battalion (Pennsylvania Dutch, <i>Badolya</i>?) is an annual
day of joy and festivity in Berks County. The annual training,
which gave name to the day, has long been given up, but still just
before hay-making the landlords of the country towns, such as
Kutztown or Hamburg, will advertise that they will hold the
annual battalion (without any soldiers). The peanut-venders,
the men with flying-horses, and the others who expect to reap the
harvest, come during the night before, and by six in the morning
everything is ready, and about that hour the farmers begin to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
in, wives, sons, daughters, hired men, and maids, even little children
and quite small babies.</p>

<p>“The farmers patronize the landlords by dining and drinking.
You can get a good dinner at Kutztown for less money than in
any other town I know. As for drinking, bars have even been
set up upon the second floor where the dancing took place.</p>

<p>“The old folks amuse themselves by talking together, looking
on and seeing how well their sons and daughters can dance, the
old men drinking a little whiskey, several times repeated, and perhaps
treating their wives to some sarsaparilla. By evening the old
folks will be at home; but the daughters, who could hardly expect
the young men to walk home with them as long as the sun
was shining, stay later, carrying gingerbread and pea-nuts home in
their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>“Roving gamblers also visit the battalion; and many an unwary
youth has lost all his money, earned by hard work, and,
after that was gone, has striven to better his fortune, but unsuccessfully,
by giving up his watch.”</p>

<p>The remark of the last speaker, that they still have the <i>badolya</i>,
or annual training, in Berks without any soldiers, reminds me
that they still have in Germany the <i>Kirch-weih</i>, church consecration,
or saint’s day, without going to any church at all, but dance
and are merry after harvest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was told some years back of farmers in Berks “worth from
thirty to eighty thousand dollars who never bring wheat bread to
the table except at Christmas and New Year’s. This is from their
great economy and desire to sell the wheat.”</p>

<p>Mrs. R., of Lehigh County, tells me that at her father’s they
baked wheat bread on Saturday, for Sunday, but during the week
they ate rye.</p>

<p>When her brother-in-law returned from a visit to Ohio, he said,
“<i>Daraus in Ohio, ’s is so schane. Sie essen laute waytzbrod</i>;” or,
“Out in Ohio it is so fine. They eat altogether wheat bread.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a part of the city of Lancaster which is called Germany.
Here natives of that country buy house-lots, and send
their children out to beg until they find they have a secure footing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
Nor does the average citizen disapprove of this proceeding;
although he is dissatisfied if a woman who owns two brick houses
sends to the soup-house for a free lunch.</p>

<p>I was amused one day in Lancaster by a boy’s asking, “Won’t
you give me a penny to save?” A pretty little girl, comfortably
dressed and speaking German, came into one of the newspaper
offices for help, the family having been unfortunate. When some
one gave her a penny, she took from her pocket a purse and put
her money away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three great waves of emigration, it may be said, early settled
Pennsylvania. The Quakers settled in the southeast. I have
travelled among Friends in several localities, but I never saw any
other community so strongly Quaker as Chester County.</p>

<p>The German immigration mostly lay outside of this, on the
north and west. West of Chester County lies Lancaster, settled
in a great measure by German Baptists (Mennonites), and which
is probably one of the strongest Baptist populations in the world.
Farther west the Scotch-Irish element is very strong. In the
west of the State I was surprised by hearing a physician (I will
call his name McCalmont) say that the Scotch-Irish had been the
making of Pennsylvania. It is this class, doubtless, who have
caused the region around Pittsburgh to be called the backbone of
Presbyterianism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This volume does not endeavor to describe the manners and
ways of living of all Pennsylvania Germans, but only of the majority.
People of wealth and education resemble each other in
most civilized lands. And although the Pennsylvania Germans
are principally devoted to agriculture, yet about twenty per cent.,
as I estimate, have gone into cities and into other employments.
Among those who have aided less or more in the publication of this
volume are ministers, lawyers, physicians, editors, bankers, merchants,
and teachers of Pennsylvania German origin. Many persons
of note in Pennsylvania have been of German descent, from
Peter Muhlenberg, a Lutheran preacher, who commanded a regiment
in the Revolution, to a number of governors of this State,—Snyder,
Hiester, Shulze, Wolf, Ritner, Shunk, and Hartranft.
Governor Hartranft’s ancestor, then called Hertteranfft, came in
with the Schwenkfelders in 1734.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span></p>

<p>To these distinguished Pennsylvania Germans I may add Dr.
Gross, the eminent surgeon. The German blood is also found in
a great number of families in our country. It is stated that
Simon Cameron is of Scottish descent on the father’s side; and
on the mother’s is descended from Conrad Pfoutz. The Hon.
Jeremiah S. Black and William D. Howells, the well-known
author, have told me that they are partly of Pennsylvania
German origin.</p>

<p>The term Anabaptist is from the Greek, and signifies one who

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> One of Menno’s brothers is said to have been connected with
the Anabaptists of Münster, those who took up arms, etc. Of
these, whose course was so very different from the lives of our
pacific Baptists in this country. Menno may have received some,
after their defeat, to come under the peaceable rule. There are
in the Netherlands, says a recent authority, 40,000 Mennonites.
They are a true, pure Netherlandish appearance, which is older
than the Reformation, and therefore must not be identified with
the Protestantism of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Menno does not merit to be called the father of the Netherlandish
Mennonites, but rather the first shepherd of the scattered
sheep,—the founder of their church community.</p>

<p>The ground-thought from which Menno proceeded was not, as
with Luther, justification by faith, or, as with the Swiss Reformers,
the absolute dependence of the sinner upon God, in the work
of salvation. The holy Christian life, in opposition to worldliness,
was the point whence Menno proceeded, and to which he
always returned. In the Romish church we see ruling the spirit
of Peter; in the Reformed Evangelical the spirit of Paul; in
Menno we see arise again James the Just, the brother of the
Lord.</p>

<p>See articles <i>Menno</i> and <i>Mennonites</i>, and <i>Holland</i>, in Herzog’s
“Real-Encyclopädie,” Stuttgart and Hamburg, 1858.</p>

<p>Many of the Mennonites of Holland at the present day seem to
have wandered far from the teachings of Menno, and to be very
different from the simple Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> The burying of Menno in his garden can be explained by the
great secrecy which in times of persecution attended the actions
of the persecuted sects. The family graveyards of Lancaster
County, located upon farms, may be in some degree traditional,
from times of persecution, when Baptists had no churches, but
met in secret.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> To the writer it is a question of some interest how far George
Fox, the founder of Quakerism, was acquainted with the lives,
sufferings, and writings of the Anabaptists.</p>

<p>The common people of England may readily have obtained
some knowledge of the Baptists from the number that were
cruelly put to death. In 1534, Henry VIII. commanded foreigners
who had been baptized in infancy, and had been rebaptized,
to leave the realm in twelve days, on pain of death. It
seems that certain Dutch Baptists braved the threatened punishment;
for twenty-six were, in different places, and at different
dates, burned within a few years. Under Edward VI., many
Baptists suffered extreme punishment, Cranmer and Latimer,
Ridley and John Rogers, either approving or actually assisting as
inquisitors. See “The Baptists; Who they are, and What they
have done,” by George B. Taylor, D.D.</p>

<p>The year 1534, in which Henry VIII. issued the proclamation
alluded to, was the time of the Anabaptist occupation of Münster.
The feelings of Henry towards the Peasants’ War and the Münster
kingdom doubtless resembled those of his successor, in 1798,
towards the French revolutionists,—but George III. did not put
any one to death by fire.</p>

<p>Since the above was written has been published Barclay’s “Inner
Life of the Religious Societies of the Commonwealth,” London,
1876. This author speaks of George Fox as having promulgated
opinions and founded churches closely approximating to the
Mennonite churches in Holland. He further says George Fox
tells us that he had an uncle in London who was a Baptist.</p>

<p>In quoting from the Martyr-book I employ the English version,
“Martyr’s Mirror.” I have lately had an opportunity of seeing
an old German copy, from the press of the Brotherhood at Ephrata,

English version, and I suspect there are other variations.</p>

they edify the community by the simplicity of their manners, and
application to arts and industry; and partly because we fear no
rebellion from a sect who make it an article of their faith never
to bear arms.’ The said industry and frugality they carried with
them to Pennsylvania, and thereby are become very wealthy.”—<span class="smcap">Morgan

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Several towns and townships in southeastern Pennsylvania
bear record of the Palatinate, etc. In Lancaster County we have
Strasburg, doubtless named for that city in Alsace, and both town

for the land of their origin to bestow Swiss names upon our
Lancaster County towns. What wonder?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> “This year of which I am now writing must ever be remembered
as the most fatal to the Protestant religion. In February a
king of England declared himself a papist. In June, Charles, the
Elector Palatine, dying without issue, the electoral dignity went
to the house of Newburgh, a most bigoted popish family. In October
the King of France recalled and vacated the edict of Nantes.”—<i>Burnet’s

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> This was twenty-eight years after the founding of Penn’s
colony. Several years earlier, or in 1701, some Mennonites bought
land in Germantown, and in 1708 built a church (or meeting-house).
For this information I am obliged to Dr. Seidensticker,
of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>“In the year 1708 about fifty Palatines, who were Lutherans
and were ruined, came over to England. Queen Anne allowed
them a shilling a day, and took care to have them transported to
the plantations; and from these circumstances there arose a general
disposition among all the poor of that country to come over.
They came to Holland in great bodies: the Anabaptists there
were particularly helpful to them, both in subsisting those in
Holland and in transporting them to England. Great numbers
of these were sent to Ireland, but most of them to the plantations
in North America, where it is believed their industry will quickly
turn to a good account.”—See Burnet’s “Own Time.” I am told
that of those thus sent to Ireland many afterwards came to
America; of such was Philip Embury, who, being converted in
Ireland, came to New York, and was the first to introduce Methodism
on the continent. He and his family were from the Palatinate.</p>

<p>Mention has just been made of Lutherans going to England
from the Palatinate. I infer that many who fled thence were of
the Reformed Church. The French Huguenots would in Germany
probably join the Reformed Church?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> The question has been discussed, what did the Germans select
the limestone lands, and the Scotch-Irish take those less fruitful?
Different hints upon this subject may be found in Day’s Historical
Collections of Pennsylvania. Under the head of Lancaster
County he says that a number of Scotch-Irish, in consequence of
the limestone land being liable to frost and heavily wooded, seated
themselves (1763) along the northern line of the counties of Chester
and Lancaster. It seems that the Germans did not fear the
labor of clearing off heavy timber.</p>

<p>A gentleman of Lancaster County says that ninety in one hundred
of the regular members of the Mennonite churches are
farmers, and that they follow the limestone land as the needle
follows the pole.</p>

Meylin, of West Lampeter Township, for a copy of the act.
There appear to have been among the Palatines who came into
our county some Huguenot families; but, from intermarrying
with the Germans, and speaking the dialect, they are considered
“Dutch.” The name of the Bushong family is said to have been

conveyed the produce of the interior to Philadelphia. With their
long bodies roofed with white canvas, they went along almost, I
might say, like moving houses. They were drawn by six powerful
horses, at times furnished with trappings and bells; and the
wagoner’s trade was one of importance.</p>

to, the more severe rule, distasteful to brethren in Alsace,
etc., and enforced the ban of excommunication upon some or
all of those who disagreed with him. Appleton’s Cyclopædia
calls him Amman, and says that the Amish rose in 1693, in
Alsace. A small pamphlet upon this subject has been published

<p><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> Traditionary stories exist in our county concerning the Swiss
origin, etc., of certain families. I have heard one concerning the
Engles and one of the Stauffers. A member of the Johns family
has also told me of their Swiss origin, and of their name being
formerly written Tschantz.</p>

<p>It is probable that other traditionary stories concerning Swiss
families could now be collected, if some one would exert himself
to do it before their custodians “fall asleep.” But let those who
gather these stories beware of the “fine writer,” lest he add
what he considers embellishments, and make the narratives improbable.</p>

<p>The Stauffer traditions were mentioned to me by a venerable
member of the family, one who has kindly lent me his aid and
sympathy in some of my records of the “Pennsylvania Dutch.”
John Stauffer is now a great-grandfather, and he calculates that
it was, at the nearest, his own great-great-grandfather who, with
his mother and his three brothers, came to this country, his ancestors
being of Swiss origin. “The mother,” says my neighbor (in
substance), “weighed three hundred, and the sons made a wagon,
all of wood, and drawed her to the Rhine. When they got to
Philadelphia, they put their mother into the wagon and drawed
her up here to Warwick township. There they settled on a pretty
spring; that is what our people like.”</p>

<p>The reader of this little story may remember the “pious Æneas,”
who “from the flames of Troy, upon his shoulders,” the old Anchises
bore. [John Stauffer is now dead, 1882.]</p>

<p>The tradition of the Engle family was narrated to me by two
of its members. Mr. Henry M. Engle has felt some difficulty in
reconciling the tradition with the fact of the family’s having been
in this country only about one hundred years, and with his idea
that the Swiss persecution must have ceased before that period.
But we have seen that some Baptist families tarried in the Palatinate,
etc., before coming here, and a circumstance like the imprisonment
of one of their women would be remembered among
them for a long time.</p>

<p>Tradition says that it was the grandmother’s mother or grandmother
of Henry M. Engle and Jacob M. Engle, who was a prisoner
in Switzerland for her faith. The turnkey’s wife sympathized
with the prisoner, because she knew that Annie had children at
home. So she said to her, in the Swiss dialect, “Annie, if I were
you, I would go away once.” (“Annie, wann i die wär, i det
mohl geh.”—“Annie, wenn ich dich wäre, ich thut einmal
gehen.”)</p>

<p>She therefore set Annie to washing clothes, and, turning her
back upon her, gave her opportunity to escape.</p>

<p>Annie’s husband was not a Baptist; nevertheless, he was so
friendly as to prepare a hiding-place for her, into which she could
go down, if the persecutors came, by means of a trap-door; and
she was never taken prisoner again.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> The <i>Herald of Truth</i>, a Mennonite paper of this country,
under the date of July, 1873, contains a “Letter of Authority,”
beginning, “We, the Bishops and Directors of the entire body of
the Swiss Mennonites in the colonies of Kotusufka, in the district
(county or canton) of Schitomir, state of Volkinien, Russia.”</p>

<p>This Letter of Authority concerns the proposed migration above
alluded to. Of the six names signed thereto, one at least appears
to belong also to this county of Lancaster, where it is now
sometimes written Graybill; in the Russian letter Krehbiehl. A
similar name is found among the Schwenckfelders, who were of
Silesian origin.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> A friend tells me that he once heard a discourse from a celebrated
Dunker preacher, named Sarah Reiter. She was allowed
to preach, it seems, by a liberal construction of Paul’s celebrated
edict, because she was unmarried. Even when afterward married,
by a more liberal construction still, the liberty to preach was not
forbidden her. Possibly it was assumed that her <i>husband at home</i>
was not able to answer all her questions upon spiritual matters.
She removed to Ohio.</p>

<p>In the Encyclopædia Americana the following are given as
propositions of some of the former Anabaptists: “Impiety prevails
everywhere. It is therefore necessary that a new family of
holy persons should be founded, enjoying without distinction of
sex the gift of prophecy, and skill to interpret divine revelations.
Hence they need no learning, for the internal word is more than
the outward expression.”</p>

<p>At this time, however, while our German Baptists still believe
in an unpaid, untaught ministry, none of them, I think, hold to
the doctrine that the gift of prophecy or preaching is without distinction
of sex. In this respect, George Fox seems to have agreed
with the early Anabaptists just mentioned.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> A new movement in German theology arose in the second half
of the seventeenth century, through Spener, the founder of Pietism.
The central principle of Pietism was that Christianity was
first of all life, and that the strongest proof of the truth of its doctrines
was to be found in the religious experience of the believing
subject. The principles of the Pietists were in the main shared by
the Moravians. (See American Cyclopædia, article <i>German Theology</i>.)
Compare this statement of the main principle of Pietism
with this of the Anabaptists, whom the mass of our Dunkers so
much resemble: “The opinions common to the Anabaptists are
founded on the principle that Christ’s kingdom on earth, or the
church, is a visible society of pious and holy persons, with none of
those institutions which human sagacity has devised for the ungodly.”
(See American Cyclopædia, article <i>Anabaptists</i>.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> They took for themselves the name of Brethren, says an article
in Rupp’s “Religious Denominations.” The Dunkers in our
county call themselves Brethren,—“Old Brethren,” “River Brethren,”
etc. Whether the Ephrata Dunkers took the same name,
I cannot say.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> Speaking of a certain Seventh-Day Baptist, an “Old Mennonite”

Christ is also Lord of the sabbath, and that in him no day, except
for sake of common law, is to be observed above another.” See <i>Der
Waffenlose Waechter</i> (or <i>Unarmed Watchman</i>), Jan. 1873.</p>

prepared ascension robes. One of my acquaintances went to the
roof of his house, where, in his robe, he could look for the coming
of Christ, and whence he was prepared immediately to ascend.
More recently, namely, in August of 1873, I recollect meeting
with a person who told me that he writes for Advent papers. He
was himself a <i>Time-ist</i>, thinking that “the second coming of the
Lord will take place this year.”</p>

of life in the encampment, which she could no longer bear.”—<i>Chronicon

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> These remarkable men seem to deserve especial notice. In
Rupp’s History of Lancaster County it is stated that they were
from Germany, and had been brought up Catholics. Israel Eckerlin
(Brother Onesimus) became prior of the brother-house at
Ephrata. Peter Miller, in an original letter, complains that he
obliged them to meddle with worldly things further than their obligations
permitted; and that when money came in it was put out
at interest, “contrary to our principles.”</p>

<p>They could not, however, have been very rich, for when in 1745
a bell arrived in Philadelphia, from England, which had been ordered
by Eckerlin, and which cost eighty pounds, they knew not
how to pay for it. The name of Onesimus (or Eckerlin) had been
placed upon the bell. When the news of its arrival was received,
a council was held in the presence of the spiritual father, Beissel,
and it was concluded to break the bell to pieces and bury it in the
earth. The next morning, however, the father appeared in the
council, and said that he had reflected that as the brothers were
poor, the bell should be pardoned. It therefore was sold, and was
placed upon the Lutheran church in Lancaster, where it was long
in use. Afterwards it was sold to a fire company, and is now on
the tower of the house of the Washington Company. It bears
a Latin inscription with the name of the “reverend man,” Onesimus.</p>

<p>Miller says that the prior (Eckerlin) conceived a notion to make
himself independent of Beissel, and was stripped of all his dignities.</p>

<p>The Eckerlins appear to have gone into the wilderness, and encamped
on a creek flowing into the Monongahela, in Pennsylvania,
to which stream they gave the name of Dunkard Creek, which it
still bears. They afterward seem to have removed to Dunkards’
Bottom, on Cheat River, which they made their permanent residence.
After many vicissitudes, Miller tells us that Eckerlin and
his brother were taken prisoners by Mohawks, and sold to Quebec,
whence they were transported to France, “where, after our prior
had received the tonsure and become a friar of their church, they
both died.” The Ephrata Chronicle says (chap. xxiii.) that the
prior went <i>out of time</i> twenty years before Beissel. The latter died
in 1768. By the former reckoning, the prior went out of time in
1748, or about three years after the difficulty about the bell at
Ephrata.</p>

of Palatines with their families, imported in the ship “Thistle”
of Glasgow, from Rotterdam, last from Cowes. Among these occurs
Peter Müller, whom by a note Rupp connects with the Peter
Miller of the text. As to the name John Peter, as given by
Andrews, it is surprising to see how many of these immigrants
bear the names of John, Hans, Johan, Johann, and Johannes,
prefixed to other names. I count twenty in a column of thirty-four.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_59" href="#FNanchor_59" class="label">[59]</a> When this letter was written, Miller was about eighty years

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> In the year 1740, says Fahnestock, there were thirty-six single
brethren in the cloisters, and thirty-five sisters; and at one time
the society, including the members living in the neighborhood,
numbered nearly three hundred.</p>

<p>Rev. C. Endress says that some were anxious to retain the solitary
life, and some (it appears) were opposed to giving to Beissel
the title of Father. Sangmeister left the society and retired to
Virginia (whence, however, he returned to Ephrata). “His
book,” says the same writer, “is much tainted with bitterness,
and undertakes to cast a dark shade upon the whole establishment.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[61]</a> Larger accommodations were afterward built in the meadow
below; a sister-house, called Saron, a brother-house, named
Bethania, etc. Most of these are still standing, I believe, in 1882;
but the former buildings on the hill long since disappeared.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a> The Ephrata Chronicle speaks nearly in this manner of that
of the sisters:</p>

<p>Their dress was ordered, like that of the brethren, so that little
was to be seen of the disagreeable human figure (<i>von dem verdriesslichen
Bild das durch die Sünd ist offenbar worden</i>). They
wore caps like the brethren, but not pointed ones. While at work
these caps or cowls hung down their backs; but when they saw
anybody, they drew them over their heads, so that but little could
be seen of their faces. But the principal token of their spiritual
betrothal was a great veil, which in front covered them altogether,
and behind down to the girdle. Roman Catholics who saw this
garment said that it resembled the habit of the scapular.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> The Chronicle tells us that once, in Beissel’s absence, a costly
feather bed was brought into his sleeping-room. He made use of
it one night, but sent it away afterward,—and not even in dying
could be brought to give up the sleeping-bench (<i>die Schlafbanck</i>).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> In “Carey’s Museum” for 1789, will be found a letter from a
British officer to the editor of the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, whence it
appears that at that time, 1786, a rug was laid upon the sleeping-bench.
The writer says that each brother had a cell, with a closet
adjoining; that the smallness of the rooms was very disagreeable,
and that they were not clean. The churches were clean and neat,
but perfectly unadorned, except by some German texts. The
house “occupied by the nuns” was uniformly clean, and the cells
were in excellent order. (Some of the statements of this writer
appear very loose.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> At Ephrata, in the winter of 1872, I was told that Miller was
once met, as he was taking a load of paper from the mill to the
press, by a certain man named Widman. This Widman, according
to tradition, had been a vestryman in Miller’s former church.
“Is this the way they treat you,” said Widman, “harnessing you
up to a wheelbarrow?” and he spat in Miller’s face.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> Of one of the collections of hymns published at Ephrata,
Fahnestock says that four hundred and forty-one were written
by Beissel, seventy-three by the brethren in the cloister, one
hundred by the single sisters, and one hundred and twelve by the
out-door members. Endress speaks in unfavorable terms of the
literary merits of some of the Ephrata hymns.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> Dr. Fahnestock resided for a while in the latter part of his life
in the sister-house, at Ephrata. Here Mr. Rupp, the historian,
visited him. Rev. Mr. Shrigley, librarian of the Pennsylvania

Fahnestock’s venerable appearance.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[69]</a> In after-years they seem to have been much troubled by litigation.
Dr. Fahnestock says that they considered contention with
arms, and at law, unchristian; but that they unfortunately had to
defend themselves often in courts of justice. To set an example of
forbearance and Christian meekness, they suffered themselves for
a long time to be plundered, until forbearance was no longer a virtue.
He says (Hazard’s Register, 1835) that the society is just
escaping from heavy embarrassments which they incurred in defending
themselves from the aggressions of their neighbors. The
British officer, whose statement was published as early as 1789,
speaks of Peter Miller as often engaged in litigation.</p>

<p>In a recent work (Belcher’s History of Religious Denominations,
1854), the Seventh-Day Baptists at Ephrata are said to possess
about one hundred and forty acres.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> Morgan Edwards, in speaking of the recluses at Ephrata, says
that they took the vow of celibacy. But, as so many of our German
Baptists are opposed to oaths, I presume that they did not.
“Teach, by example, that a promise is truly an oath,” says a late
Pennsylvania paper.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> A writer in the Chronicle speaks of being at one of the count’s
conferences, where there were Mennonites, Separatists, and Baptists.
But when he came home, he told the <i>vorsteher</i> that he
regarded the count’s conference as a snare to bring simple awakened
souls again into infant-baptism and church-going. Then
they held a council, and resolved to have a yearly conference of
their own.</p>

<p>The above expression—infant-baptism and church-going—sounds
so much like the account of the Baptist or Anabaptist
persecutions narrated in the Martyr-book, that we might almost
conclude that the Dunkers had a direct connection with the Anabaptists,
instead of originating among the Pietists. But it will
be remembered that the Ephrata Dunkers had printed an edition
of the great Martyr-book, and it is most probable that some of
them were familiar with it. Still, there may have been among
the Pietists some who were or had been Baptists.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> The Ephrata Chronicle says that, as the enemy approached
(the Indians came within thirteen miles of Ephrata), many persons
sought refuge in the cloister, with those who were themselves
in need of protection. As reports of murders reached Ephrata
day after day, the celibates (<i>Einsamen</i>) became despondent, and
even the leader turned pale,—a thing that had never been witnessed
before. When danger was so imminent, the fathers proposed
to take the sisters away on wagons to a safer place. It was
then that Beissel received by night a divine revelation to the effect
that no Einsamer should perish by the hands of the Indians.</p>

<p>Accordingly they remained at their station, and it really turned
out as Beissel had predicted. The people who took refuge in the
monastery probably stayed at Ephrata, not with a view of finding
protection behind the wooden walls of the cloister, but for the sake
of shelter and support. The statement that the government sent
a company of soldiers for the protection of Ephrata seems to be
verified by the mention in the Chronicle of <i>Rothröcke</i> or Redcoats.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="label">[76]</a> The Mennonites and Quakers were peaceably disposed towards
the Indians, but the Presbyterians from the north of Ireland, who
had settled at Paxton, felt a deadly animosity against them, and, as
Day says, against the peaceful Moravians and Quakers, who wished
to protect the Indians, at the expense, as the Paxton men thought,
of the lives of the settlers. The Paxton rangers were commanded
by the Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Colonel Elder, who seems
to have opposed the massacre of the Indians at Lancaster by the
“Paxton boys.” Day says that no historian ought to excuse or
justify the murders at Lancaster and Conestoga, and adds that
they must ever remain dark and bloody spots in our provincial
history.</p>

evidently used to gratify one of the strongest natural affections of
the human heart. “The Redeemer was their bridegroom or bride....
He was the little infant they carried under their hearts, the

Quakers. In the same aria they are called <i>die Friedlichen</i>, or
the peaceful ones. One of Schwenkfeld’s volumes, a collection,
states that they were gathered and put in order by <i>the fellow-confessors

people who had accepted Schwenkfeld’s teachings stood back in
stillness, not being able conscientiously to agree with these teachers.
This was very offensive to the parsons, and they soon made
use of their high dignity against tender consciences to force such
persons to their means of grace,—to make them come to the baptismal
font, to the pulpit, and the altar.—<i>Schwenkfeld’s Erläuterung</i>,
chap. iv. The Schwenkfelders express the opinion that the
action of the Lutheran clergy, in calling attention to them, frequently
caused their persecution by the Catholic authorities.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="label">[139]</a> Hence we may infer that the Schwenkfelders forbade marriages
with those not of their own persuasion. During the period of their
troubles it seems that marriage by the church was at times refused
them, no doubt from their refusing the sacrament. Maimed
funeral rites were also among the persecutions of which they complained.
In speaking thus of their decline, they may, however,
overestimate their numbers in former times.</p>

<p>The following characteristic sketch may be introduced here
nearly in the words of the original: The two pastors in Harpersdorf
having been called to a new church, there came as pastor Herr
John Samuel Neander (the pastor Neander who died in July
1759). He was by nature a very fiery man, so that he hardly
knew how to govern his passions; by birth a Brandenburger, from
Frankfort on the Oder. When he was installed, the Herr Superintendent
in Liegnitz brought before him that he was a stranger,
and therefore he might not know how it was in Harpersdorf, that
there was a people there, who had already lived there about two
hundred years, called Schwenkfelders. Therefore he would give
him good advice, that he should leave these people in peace; preceding
pastors had tried it enough, and had accomplished nothing
by force. But if he thought he could not endure these people, he
should say so, and another would be put into the place.</p>

<p>But Herr Neander promised everything good, and did not keep to
it. For soon after entering upon his office he gave out that he had
sworn to bury none of the Schwenkfelders as before practised, and
this he began to carry out. See <i>Erläuterung</i>, chap. v.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140" class="label">[140]</a> The aria already alluded to says,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Nor the wife accompany her husband to the house of death.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The word that I have translated cattle-path, etc., is <i>viehweg</i>.
A note upon this verse of the aria says, “1722. Three hundred
persons lie upon the cow-paths at Harpersdorf and Langendorff.”
If so many were buried during the time of the Catholic mission,
these people must have been numerous.</p>

<p>In Allentown, a young gentleman tells me that the people of
Lehigh County, all through, eat Schwenkfelder-cake. “Our

motives; some for religious freedom, and some to earn their bread.

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> Mr. Weiser tells us, in speaking of the Schwenkfelders, that
on a late occasion, having heard that the tombs of their ancestors,
near Liegnitz and Gorlitz, were fast being desecrated, and the earth,
with their very dust, carried away for road-making purposes, their
Pennsylvania posterity collected a handsome sum and forwarded
it to the authorities, with a view of purchasing the grounds, and
having them set apart and enclosed as the burying-ground of the
Silesian Schwenkfelders. It is not believed, however, he adds,
that their moneys were appropriated to the laudable end which
they had in view.</p>

<p>This narrative might apply to those Silesians who were buried
upon the cow-paths (Mr. Weiser says, taken to the carrion pit or
bone commons), but does it apply to them after they had taken
refuge at Gorlitz?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="label">[156]</a> All Quakers do not teach the inferiority of the written word.
Mr. Weiser says, “In general terms it may be said that Caspar
Schwenkfeld has been the George Fox of Silesia, or the veritable
George Fox, perhaps somewhat educated and sublimated.”</p>

<p>Although some of the doctrines taught by George Fox seem to
have been given before him by Schwenkfeld, yet were these not
previously taught among the Anabaptists, and possibly among the
Waldenses?</p>

<p>It has been said that the better classes of Anabaptists claimed a
descent from the Waldenses, the Wickliffites, and the Hussites,
who had struggled for a church separated from the world and distinguished
by the holiness of its members.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="label">[158]</a> On his death-bed Schwenkfeld declared that he believed that
all in the Old and New Testament was profitable for salvation to
the elect; that he was certain that his own writings, if read impartially,
and after prayer, agreed with Holy Scripture, but he
must acknowledge to the praise of God that they proceeded more
from gracious revelation.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_162" href="#FNanchor_162" class="label">[162]</a> The thoughtful reader may perhaps find something in this answer
to contrast with these passages from the decrees of the late
Ecumenical Council at Rome:</p>

<p>“If any one shall say that human sciences ought to be pursued
in such a spirit of freedom that any one may be allowed to hold
as true their assertions, even when opposed to revealed doctrine,
and that such assertions may not be condemned by the church, let
him be <i>anathema</i>. If any one shall say that at any time it may
come to pass, in the progress of science, that the doctrines set forth
by the church must be taken in another sense than that in which
the church has ever received and yet receives them, let him be
<i>anathema</i>.” Quoted from a report of a dogmatic decree on Catholic
faith, confirmed 1870.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
